Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon does a fantastic job of capturing the creative and open qualities of imaginative play. What makes the story even awesome-r is that Chabon doesn't forget the trials of being a superhero -- running out of energy (needing a snack), staving off trashing a city in anger (temper tantrum), and needing a big hug from a superhero's biggest ally, his mom.\nThe dazzling illustrations by Jake Parker are bright and engaging.

Many of his poems are bite-sized -- just two to six lines longs. Most reflect a kid-like goofiness, some reveal the mature wisdom of someone who remains young at heart, as in \"The Dollhouse\": You can't crawl back in the dollhouse --\/ You've gotten too big to get in.\/ You've got to live here\/ Like the rest of us do.\/ You've got to walk roads\/ That are winding and new.\/ But oh, I wish I could\/ Crawl back with you.\/ Into the dollhouse again. \nSilverstein's line drawings are the perfect accompaniment to his flights of fancy. Some characters have the deadpan, overburdened demeanor of a person in a New Yorker cartoon. Some have the loose, offhanded look of a notebook doodle. All are guaranteed to give a lift to readers of any age.

It\u2019s a fantasy horse story for teens who hate both fantasies and horse stories: The pulsing danger of the capaill uisce (water horses) is seductive. The narration shifts between Puck and Sean, both strong and appealing voices. The two perspectives together paint a vivid portrait of Thisby and the solid supporting cast. Stiefvater\u2019s Thisby is the kind of place readers want to get lost in: She drops so many intriguing hints into the lives of the secondary characters, you wish you could follow them a bit more too. The American Library Association named Scorpio Races a 2012 Michael L. Printz Honor Book for excellence in literature for young adults.\nThe story is a thrill ride, so much so that the romance sneaks in quietly.

Green wrote this book after making a friendship with a teen with cancer, and his attention to detail is remarkable, from descriptions of equipment to what it feels like to be stared at by well-meaning strangers. Readers may be perplexed about an alcoholic author who begins making appearances in Hazel's life, and may be unsure if he is really there or just a symbol. This decision seems a bit out of step with what is otherwise a realistic and emotionally harrowing book about love and loss.

Each character, quirky and unique in his or her own way, is on a road toward self-discovery and holds an invaluable role that completes their unbreakable, forged family unit.\nThe female leads (Charlotte, Tessa, and Sophie) model intelligence, strength, and independence. Although each plays a distinct role (one as head of the Institute, one an American mundane, the other a servant), each offers a strength the others lack. Charlotte is independent, Tessa is tenacious, and Sophie is resilient.

Once again, the book follows several points of view, and some of the secondary characters are just as compelling as Froi, especially Phaedra, the estranged Charynite wife of Lucian of the Monts; and Lady Beatriss, who finally realizes that she wants Captain Trevanion to know what really happened to her during the decade they spent apart.

Author Meg Rosoff muses on mortality, personal responsibility, free will, faith, love, and sacrifice in this wry novel. Her approach may seem impudent, but it reveals deep compassion for humankind in its search for meaning and understanding. By reimagining Christianity as more akin to the bickering, flawed gods of ancient myths, she explores these themes with both a personal and grander perspectives.\n \nThe young characters of Bob and Lucy are the least appealing: Bob is an irredeemable lout, and Lucy is thinly drawn, an idea more than a person. The supporting characters -- Mr. B, Estelle, Lucy's bitter co-worker Luke, the discouraged vicar, and the Eck, Bob's hapless pet -- are the real soul of the story, and the ones who's hopes, dreams, and disappointments will linger long after the book is done.

This is a beautifully written exploration of how one fateful summer changes so much in a 17-year-old girl's life. Matson manages to keep Taylor's emotions running high -- how could they not when she's about to lose a parent? -- while also sprinkling the sadness of anticipatory grief with moments of genuine humor and even romance.\nMatson creates a protagonist who's achingly real. Taylor is occasionally insecure (a classic middle child, she has a genius older brother and a ballet prodigy younger sister) and slightly clueless about how to handle her initial spark of attraction to Henry. While the romance is intense (Henry is quite the swoon-worthy love interest), it's not all about stolen kisses in the rain. This is a story about the love between fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, and lifelong friends. The plot will resonate deeply with any reader who has lost a parent. Kids, you should get to know -- really know -- your parents, the author is saying, because you carry them with you always, whether you know it or not.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Second Chance Summer","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=PXbzODssJXwC","isbn":"978-1416990673","datePublished":"2012-05-08","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Morgan Matson","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/3351454.Morgan_Matson"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/11071466.jpg?itok=XC_5spao"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Never Fall Down","datePublished":"2012-05-07","description":"&quot;Never Fall Down&quot; is a powerful, compelling story whose subject matter is both horrific and inspiring, since the narrator survived and went on to have a good life and do good things.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/never-fall-down","reviewBody":"&quot;Never Fall Down&quot; is a powerful, compelling story whose subject matter is both horrific and inspiring, since the narrator survived and went on to have a good life and do good things.

In the tradition of second installments, Roth introduces in-depth exposition, new characters, seemingly unsurmountable challenges, and cliffhanger-level twists to move the story forward. The factionless folks are particularly fascinating, since as the literal outcasts of the book's highly stratified society, they're unpredictable and free thinking. It's also refreshing to have so many women as leaders, even though they have completely opposing agendas.\nAs in Divergent, INSURGENT centers on Tris, a beautifully flawed heroine much in the Katniss Everdeen (of The Hunger Games) mold of fierce and unflinchingly courageous young women. Unlike Katniss, however, Tris only has eyes for Tobias\/Four, and he for her. Their intensely mature relationship far surpasses many of the superficial romances in young adult books. With a devotion and a certainty that belies their age, Tris and Tobias face each obstacle as equal partners who will do anything and everything to keep everyone safe in unthinkably dangerous world.

She uses her directed love at those around her, all the time -- even people so unworthy of her love. It's her superpower. A smart, questioning girl who loves learning about philosophy and existence, Astrid uses the teachings of Zeno, Socrates, and Plato to help her discover that whether she's straight, bi, gay, or celibate, she is who she is, not who others (even the girl she loves) want her to be -- and there's something glorious in that revelation.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Ask the Passengers","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=o1ko9pK2_Q0C","isbn":"978-0316194686","datePublished":"2012-10-23","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"A.S.

As the first book in a new series, Phoenix avoids the frequent pitfalls of spending too much time in world-building or overselling the previous, related series; it works well as its own story, and leaves readers wanting to know what happens next with these characters.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Eisenhart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mary-eisenhart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Phoenix: The Five Ancestors Out of the Ashes, Book 1","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=jHbubrR_WCQC","isbn":"978-0375870187","datePublished":"2012-09-25","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jeff Stone","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeff_Stone_(author)"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/phoenix.jpg?itok=lWUgzcfs"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Linnea in Monet's Garden","datePublished":"2012-11-30","description":"&quot;Linnea in Monet's Garden&quot; would be a great addition to any kid's library.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/linnea-in-monets-garden","reviewBody":"&quot;Linnea in Monet's Garden&quot; would be a great addition to any kid's library.

Forman has already impressed readers with a moving novel about the difference a day makes, so it's no surprise she's taken the idea and inserted strangers instead of estranged exes as she did in Where She Went. This is a truly transformative coming-of-age tale that will inspire young women to take the Shakespearean line \"to thine own self be true\" to heart. By allowing Willem to rename her Lulu (he never learns her real name that night), Allyson starts off acting like a more adventurous spirit but slowly comes to realize she is capable of so much more than meeting her parents' straight-A, pre-med, Ivy League expectations.\nThe \"&quot;Just One Day&quot;\" part of the book provides that heady feeling of falling madly and deeply for Willem, who is both edgy and safe, worldly and idealistic, mysterious and open. Every \"good girl\" secretly wonders what it's like to surrender to the unknown, and Forman touchingly conveys how even the smallest of moments is actually a monumental step in Allyson's one-day metamorphosis. Once the story shifts to the \"Just One Year\" section, Forman delves into Allyson's depression, confusion, and alienation with an authenticity that's heartbreaking. Various supporting characters add humor and depth -- like Allyson's best college friend Dee, who as a gay, black scholarship kid knows exactly what it means to play different parts for different people. Best of all, the writing never fails to express the excitement of discovering parts of yourself that you never thought existed. By the final line, you won't be able to wait to read the companion book, Just One Year, which is told from Willem's point of view.\n ","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Just One Day","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=_PMyFmXv3mEC","isbn":"978-0525425915","datePublished":"2013-01-08","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Gayle Forman","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gayle_Forman"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9780525425915-p0-v1-s260x420.jpg?itok=FeZeIRKa"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Giants Beware!","datePublished":"2013-01-09","description":"GIANTS BEWARE is written and illustrated by veterans of the kids' TV and animation industry, whose experience shows in the quick humor and colorful, cartoony illustrations.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/giants-beware","reviewBody":"GIANTS BEWARE is written and illustrated by veterans of the kids' TV and animation industry, whose experience shows in the quick humor and colorful, cartoony illustrations.

Also, it flips the stereotypical fairy tale roles of brave knight and helpless princess by making the bravest character a young redheaded girl and the pretty princess a smart and savvy young lady.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sierra Filucci","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sierra-filucci"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Giants Beware!","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=zs3-ewEACAAJ","isbn":"978-1596435827","datePublished":"2012-04-10","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jorge Aguirre","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/3033809.Jorge_Aguirre"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/giantsbeware-books.jpg?itok=IEHFI7Df"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Uses for Boys","datePublished":"2013-01-14","description":"This is a poetic book that will be a big hit with fans of coming-of-age classic House on Mango Street and other lyrical stories.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/uses-for-boys","reviewBody":"This is a poetic book that will be a big hit with fans of coming-of-age classic House on Mango Street and other lyrical stories.

There are treats on every page: Trixie cavorting in the laundry as she \"helps,\" her frantically waving arms and floppy limbs as she goes \"boneless,\" her father's herculean efforts to find Knuffle Bunny. Trixie's increasingly desperate attempts to communicate and her father's increasing exasperation with her seeming unreasonableness will resonate with both children and parents. And Willems' sweet story will delight both. \n ","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Darienne Stewart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/darienne-stewart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Knuffle Bunny: A Cautionary Tale","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/490867.Knuffle_Bunny","isbn":"978-0786818709","datePublished":"2004-09-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mo Willems","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mo_Willems"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/knuffle-bunny-300x300.jpg?itok=P9VnmQeG"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Wainscott Weasel","datePublished":"2012-04-05","description":"Tor Seidler brings the Wainscott woods to life with vivid descriptions of nature and vibrant, charming characters.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-wainscott-weasel","reviewBody":"Tor Seidler brings the Wainscott woods to life with vivid descriptions of nature and vibrant, charming characters.

This plays well with themes raised in the first book: Misfit Olive wants a place to belong, and often forgets her loved ones and makes bad choices in the process. These are themes that even non-magical tweens can certainly relate to.\n\tAlso, readers might be too caught up in the adventure leading up to a tense final faceoff to notice the lyrical language, but author West is a an award-winning poet, and her writing is often quite beautiful.

It deftly manages a cast of hundreds, each member with his or her own allegiances and dilemmas. But it's the beloved core we first met in Finnikin and Froi that shines in this final installment. All of these characters can be infuriating and selfish and stubborn, but somehow you root for the half-mad Quintana and the passionate Isaboe to stop hating each other enough to see that they're so ridiculously alike they could be sisters -- each with their matching ideal mates in Finnikin and Froi. Their unborn sons -- one doomed and one blessed -- even share a connection in the womb.\nIn addition to the central quartet of the Lumaterans Finnikin and Isaboe and the Charynites Froi and Quintana, the most heartbreaking love story belongs to Lucian and Phaedra, a Lumateran and a Charynite who love each other desperately even as they're both pulled in by duties to their own kingdoms. It's these three relationships, along with their too-large-to-name families, that make this such a beautifully crafted tale. You'll cry as a mother weeps at the loss of her baby, only to nurse another baby she feels compelled to protect. You'll laugh as Finnikin and Froi fight, debate, and love each other like brothers. And when you finish the last satisfying sentence, you'll want to go right back to Finnikin of the Rock and start the breathtaking journey to Lumatere once again, because it's a place of heartbreak and joy, like Middle-earth and Narnia and the wizarding world.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Quintana of Charyn","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/10165761-quintana-of-charyn","isbn":"978-0763658359","datePublished":"2013-04-23","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Melina Marchetta","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Melina_Marchetta"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9780763663605-p0-v1-s260x420.jpg?itok=s_A3XTBK"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Blackout","datePublished":"2012-04-18","description":"In an age of digital distractions, a power outage is a major disruption -- and, as John Rocco illustrates in this beautiful picture book, a rare opportunity.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/blackout","reviewBody":"In an age of digital distractions, a power outage is a major disruption -- and, as John Rocco illustrates in this beautiful picture book, a rare opportunity.

And like the first book in the series, this one leaves plenty of perils and unresolved issues for the next installment.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Eisenhart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mary-eisenhart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Hero's Guide to Storming the Castle","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/16248123-the-hero-s-guide-to-storming-the-castle","isbn":"978-0062118455","datePublished":"2013-04-30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Christopher Healy","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/418792.Christopher_Healy"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/stormingcastle.jpg?itok=zmZeOoZv"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Reluctant Assassin: W.A.R.P., Book 1","datePublished":"2013-05-13","description":"What an exhilarating series start!

It really is impossible to put THE RELUCTANT ASSASSIN down. (And when you read the vivid descriptions of Victorian slums you'll be too queasy for meals anyway, so it's not a problem.) The teen characters are fantastic -- Chevie especially, with all the cheek she gives her superiors and her raw FBI rookie talent.\nThe anything-but-reluctant assassin Garrick is pure villain, but he's not at all two-dimensional; it's particularly gripping when Colfer switches to his warped point of view. And all the dangers Chevie and Riley race into slyly peel away another layer of mystery and intrigue; it's brilliantly meticulous storytelling at high speed. Sci-fi fans ages 13 to 113, don't miss this one.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

Anyone who attended a high school where sports seemed bigger than books -- and that would be lots of them -- will feel a familiar tug at the description of athletes loafing by on low academic expectations, on the pulse of a school that beats fastest on Friday night. But this book pulls back the curtain on football fever and offers a deeply detailed, nuanced look at the risks and rewards of such fervor -- the way racism may disappear on the field but persists the next day in the hallways, the way the very parents who themselves saw their lives derailed by physical injury encourage their sons to take the same risk, the way girls and minorities forever play second fiddle in the cult of masculinity -- and emerges with a troubling, sympathetic portrait. \nThis book's mature themes make it better for older kids, and great for parents to engage with those readers about the thornier issues of American life, most of which are fresh today, in spite of the book's original publication date of 1990.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tracy Moore","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/tracy-moore"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=Ii4u4V_DJosC","isbn":"978-0306809903","datePublished":"2000-08-11","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"H.G.

The book covers a tremendous range of styles and eras: seminal jazz artists (Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong); early R&amp;B greats (Ray Charles, Louis Jordan); first-gen rock 'n' rollers (Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard); a few country legends (Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Johnny Cash); pop crooners (Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole); influential soul sensations (Aretha Franklin, Curtis Mayfield, Sam Cooke, James Brown, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder); two superstar 1960s groups (the Beatles and the Beach Boys); singer-songwriters (Bob Dylan, Carole King, Joni Mitchell); and the undisputed king of reggae (Bob Marley). Each enthusiastic, two-page, large-type bio has interesting anecdotes, facts, and analysis of what's special about the artist, plus a five-song playlist of recommended listening.\nThe writing is clear, concise, and well researched. The typography is sometimes jarring, with certain phrases emphasized in larger (and LARGER) type to bring home a point, but it makes for visually stimulating reading. Co-author Robbie Robertson, famous for leading the popular '60s\/early '70s group The Band, offers brief personal remarks about each musician. The only quibble is the seemingly random order of the profiles.

Uncle Murray steps in to explain plot versus theme, closed versus open endings, and how a writer makes use of a dictionary, thesaurus, and rhyming dictionary.\n \nAt the book's end, a character accuses the author of stealing the idea for the interplay between creator and character from Looney Tunes shorts. Bruel says those cartoons inspired him but he didn't copy them, and he encourages readers to write Bad Kitty books.

The plot goes backward, sideways, and forward all at once, and on every page you realize what a genius Smith is to write this book about history and life and the importance of books for clever teens who will appreciate his candor, authenticity, and mastery of language.\nAs the bibliophile Austin so acutely explains, \"you could never get everything in a book,\" but \"good books are always about everything.\" It's a bold statement, but Smith is clearly up to the task of writing an incredibly good book. Like any other remarkable book, this one is not for everyone, especially younger teens who aren't mature enough to read the word \"horny\" without breaking into fits of laughter. But mature young readers -- and, for that matter, adults -- should take in Smith's command of a story that smoothly includes references to volcanoes, the Holocaust, Vietnam, the Rolling Stones, BMX bikes, the vice president's sex life, and unstoppable Iowa corn.

I wanted to remember the way Mama kept looking up toward the clouds, smiling at the birds swooping through the treetops.

It's just 262 pages, but somehow Sedgwick packs in so much detail into each of the interconnected short stories. Told from the perspective of an archaeologist, pilot, painter, ghost, vampire, a Viking, and a king, the stories take place under a different Full Moon (the Flower Moon, the Grain Moon, the Blood Moon) and explore how Eric and Merle's souls have been intertwined for more than a millennium. If a lesser writer had tried to tackle such an ambitious storyline, it no doubt would've taken way upwards of 500 pages, but Sedgwick is more than up to the task of being concise but still breathtakingly eloquent.\nYoung readers who start the book need to be mature enough to handle the horror elements, like ritual sacrifice, and to understand how to connect the dots between the Full Moons, Blessed Island's mysterious orchid, and of course, the different incarnations of Eric and Merle. Each story is in itself a miniature horror or mystery tale, but at its root, these stories are about love, in its many forms, and how a passion so deep could transcend the boundaries of time and death.

Sophie Blackall's black-and-white illustrations bring the characters to comical life.\nOne of the book's great charms is Horvath's dialogue, in which a character's speech bounces from, for example, Jane Austen to Sylvester Stallone. \" 'Mr. Bunny, how you do run on.

It's deep and dark and doesn't shy away from squirm-worthy topics like bodily fluids, sexually transmitted diseases, childbirth, child brides (by our standards), and unthinkable medieval violence, prejudice, and social practices.\nAva Bingen and Midi Sorte are clever and strong-willed characters who are wary of each other but eventually realize they must work together given their circumstances in the Lunedie court.

First-time author Piers Torday is the son of Paul Torday, whose first novel -- at 60 -- was Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. There's a certain family resemblance, most notably in the irrepressibly oddball sensibility that gathers wildly disparate elements that shouldn't work together at all, including a hefty dose of venerable tropes -- dystopian futures, prison-like boarding schools, hero's journeys, technologically enhanced villains, and lovable animals -- and deftly blends them into a fresh, irresistible new story. Alternately sweet, terrifying, and hysterically funny, the story presents distinctive, appealing characters, human and otherwise, facing a fast-paced onslaught of deadly perils.\nWhile the book's publisher says it's fine for 8-year-olds, some kids -- especially tenderhearted animal lovers and those prone to nightmares -- might find it too intense: Parents die, there's a monstrous character whose crutches turn into guns and other weapons, and animals, including cute, beloved ones, meet violent deaths.

Using an innovative design approach that combines watercolors, collage, papier mache, old newspaper clippings, and found objects, it recreates the history of an artist's life and the impact of his creations -- the simple, evocative animal balloons that are the signature of the Macy's Parade. But behind this story of how the balloons were created is the story of a boy's curiosity and passion, and how his love for tinkering led to a lifelong career in arts and crafts, without any formal training and only his mind and spirit to guide him.\nKids interesting in these subjects will find a wonderland of ideas and inspiration here. Parents may find themselves learning a thing or two about how \"upside-down puppets\" are crafted, and set out for a project around the house that could use fixing.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tracy Moore","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/tracy-moore"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Balloons over Broadway: The True Story of the Puppeteer of Macy's Parade","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/11360892-balloons-over-broadway","isbn":"978-0547199450","datePublished":"2011-11-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Melissa Sweet","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/427613.Melissa_Sweet"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/balloons-over-broadway-book.jpg?itok=eGdhwQ7A"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Red Book","datePublished":"2013-04-08","description":"With stunning images and turns that surprise and delight, &quot;The Red Book&quot; is not easily forgotten.

It's difficult to read second novels from outstanding debut authors; readers understandably believe that the sophomore effort can't be nearly as good as the first. But John Corey Whaley joins the ranks of esteemed writers such as Melina Marchetta, Rainbow Rowell, Andrew Smith, and Patrick Ness -- all YA authors who proved they were not one-hit wonders. Whaley once again focuses on a male protagonist going through a crisis readers can't personally relate to but will still empathize with because of his layered, emotional journey. Travis Coates is an ordinary teen going through something so extraordinary only one other person in the world -- a thirtysomething dad named Lawrence (the only other reanimated man to survive) -- has experienced. But we're right there with Travis as he adjusts to (and revels in) his awesome new body, gets reacquainted with his parents and his best friend Kyle (now a closeted gay college student), and misguidedly tries to win Cate back as his true love.\nTravis' story doesn't have a pat ending that will satisfy readers looking for high romance or happily-ever-afters. But teens (and parents) looking for a compelling read about a future medical possibility that doesn't seem all that far-fetched will be rewarded with rich characterization, teen humor, heartache, and a valuable lesson that happiness doesn't always mean getting everything you want but rather enjoying the healthy life you have to live.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Noggin","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=RttzUcnfE0UC","isbn":"978-1442458727","datePublished":"2014-04-08","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"John Corey Whaley","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Corey_Whaley"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/noggin.jpg?itok=9HthbeKf"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"This One Summer","datePublished":"2014-05-26","description":"&quot;This One Summer&quot; perfectly captures the awkward transition from childhood to adolescence.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/this-one-summer","reviewBody":"&quot;This One Summer&quot; perfectly captures the awkward transition from childhood to adolescence.

The scenes in the prison camp are tense and harrowing, and Dean's adventures of the road with Astrid, Jake, and Niko cover new ground rather than just repeat familiar situations.\nThe two plotlines intersect a little too neatly during the suspenseful climax, but most readers probably won't notice and will be satisfied with the book's resolution.

His background in biology and geography and his passion for Hawaii\u2019s history and traditions transform this from just another apocalyptic fantasy into a nuanced meditation on our relationship with our history, our present, and our future on this planet. Lei is a terrific heroine: She seems an ordinary girl in extraordinary circumstances, but her compassion and desire for normalcy help her surmount daunting obstacles. The relationship between father and daughter is touching and authentic. The violence is often startling and sometimes gruesome, and the collapse of civility seems frighteningly realistic.\nAslan brews a satisfying mystery by pulling together bits of Hawaiian mythology and Christian beliefs, a splash of science fiction, and a few classic apocalyptic scenarios, all grounded in ecology. Setting the story in Hawaii is convenient -- what place could be more cut off from the rest of the globe? But Aslan takes it much further, letting Hawaii's complexities serve as a microcosm of the larger world. It's an intriguing tale for anyone who loves the Hawaiian Islands -- but it might be best to read it after your holiday in paradise.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Darienne Stewart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/darienne-stewart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Islands at the End of the World","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=NzdBnwEACAAJ","isbn":"978-0385744027","datePublished":"2014-08-05","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Austin Aslan","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/7392660.Austin_Aslan"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/islands-at-the-end-of-the-world-book.jpg?itok=NqTQJWji"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Quest","datePublished":"2014-08-08","description":"Becker's wordless narratives are amazing.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/quest","reviewBody":"Becker's wordless narratives are amazing.

There's heartbreak, wisdom, and joy -- and the writing often sings. Jude and Noah's passages of reflection are written in a stream-of-consciousness style that lets readers feel as if they know and understand them. Author Jandy Nelson is particularly drawn to characters with misfit, superstitious families, and fans of her debut novel, The Sky Is Everywhere, will be awestruck once again at her ability to capture the transformative power of grief, loss, and art (music for Lenny in Sky and the visual arts for Noah and Jude in Sun). The author so vividly describes the artistic process that readers will feel the sand and stone in their hands as Jude sculpts or the charcoal as Noah sketches. Their art is what binds them but what also tears them apart.\nAs with Lenny and Joe in her first book, Nelson spends a good bit of the book tracing Noah and Jude's experiences with first love. Both of them have messy but rapturous love stories with guys who aren't perfect but might be exactly what the twins need -- if their own insecurities don't get in the way. Nelson's books aren't easy, lazy reads. They demand your attention with their lyrical writing and shifts in time. Some young readers may even be confused at times, as the sequences jump between the past and the present. Yet Jude and Noah are so alive, you really care about what happens to them.

He mostly succeeds, keeping the humor and social observation at the front of Darcy's story line, while serving up suspense and emotional intensity in Lizzie's book-within-a-book.\nIf the volume feels a little overstuffed and slightly off-balance, it's probably due to the ambitiousness of Westerfeld's undertaking.

Yes, he's that good. He captures the ethos of teen boyhood -- pimples, pranks, penis jokes, and all -- and adds in the deep and mind-boggling ways young adults and not-quite-men question the marvels of the universe, starting with their own strange histories. Finn is tired of being the \"boy in the book,\" particularly when that book is about alien invaders who want to rape and eat people (but that's his dad's crazy story, not his). What Finn wants is to hang out with Cade, and once he meets Julia, he just wants to be with her, kiss her, and think about being with and kissing her. But no matter how hard Finn tries, he can't stop thinking about the fateful day a horse headed to a knackery (rendering plant) killed his mom and changed his life.\nFinn's quirky journey of self-discovery is not for every reader, particularly those who just want escapist romances or definable genre stories. Nothing about Smith's books is superficial or easy to describe. And that's more than fine, because Smith is a stellar wordsmith who gets that the same 16-year-old guy who cracks up at his best friend's elaborate pranks and obsesses about the indignity of never having kissed a girl also can describe his seizures as a beautiful emptying of words and the inevitability of death as \"the knackery never shuts down.\" Smith provides his readers with another pivotal father-son relationship, one in which the father and son truly know, respect, and love each other, even when ugly, regrettable teen words are spoken. He also portrays young love as more than a lust-fueled (although, yes, there is lust, too) endeavor but as a meeting of open minds and tender hearts. Few authors can make you think, laugh, and cry all at once, but Smith can and does with every one of his novels.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"100 Sideways Miles","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=GwJcBAAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-1442444959","datePublished":"2014-09-02","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrew Smith","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andrew_A._Smith"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/100-sideways-miles.jpg?itok=wbTVieIR"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"\"Shouldn't You Be in School?\": All the Wrong Questions, Book 3","datePublished":"2014-10-02","description":"There\u2019s as much mystery, excitement, wit, and wordplay as ever.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/shouldnt-you-be-in-school-all-the-wrong-questions-book-3","reviewBody":"There\u2019s as much mystery, excitement, wit, and wordplay as ever.

Usually by the middle of a multi-book series, an author either phones it in, throws in an unnecessary love triangle, or bogs the plot down with so much detail it's unclear if he or she knows how everything will end. Not so with Stiefvater, who's known for meticulously tying up loose threads and intricately adding in subtext in passages obsessive readers can pore over again and again for clues about characters' feelings, desires, and outcomes. For a lyrical writer with a gift for original metaphors and evocative language, she's managed to make this third book feel simultaneously fast-paced and leisurely. You won't want it to end, even as you're racing to the final page and counting the hours until the final installment in this riveting, layered tetralogy.\nSomehow, against all odds, these books keep getting better and better. The character development, particularly for Adam and Ronan, is amazing -- as in, readers will be amazed at how perfectly these two fit together. Their scenes are so obvious they're reminiscent of Ron and Hermione's in the last two Harry Potter volumes, when you're waiting and waiting for them to stop all the hormonal bantering and bickering and just kiss already. Of course, kissing is the one thing Blue and Gansey can't do, so they make up for it with electrifying hand-holding and knee touching and basically staring at each other longingly. But the romances take a back seat to all the action, which involves new discoveries, secrets, and heartbreak -- all of which is so involved and engaging you'll just have to read it yourself. Just make sure to clear your calendar before you start.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Blue Lily, Lily Blue: The Raven Cycle, Book 3","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=tINzAwAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-0545424967","datePublished":"2014-10-22","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Maggie Stiefvater","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maggie_Stiefvater"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/17378508.jpg?itok=MVqoyl7h"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Hansel & Gretel","datePublished":"2014-11-06","description":"In most ways, HANSEL &amp; GRETEL is a straightforward retelling of the Grimms' fairy tale, but writer Neil Gaiman and illustrator Lorenzo Mattotti add their own special touches to the project.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/hansel-gretel","reviewBody":"In most ways, HANSEL &amp; GRETEL is a straightforward retelling of the Grimms' fairy tale, but writer Neil Gaiman and illustrator Lorenzo Mattotti add their own special touches to the project.

Miri is a complicated, headstrong heroine, and, in every new experience she faces, Hale excels at giving readers unexpected depth. Education is not only a one-way ticket out of sheltered life on the mountain for Miri, it's a chance to study and learn about the world, help other people, light up her brain, and ultimately make things better for her community. But in the wrong hands, knowledge can be dangerous, especially if it's used by the overzealous to misrepresent the truth in the name of a good cause.\nHale teaches readers to think through all possible points of view, to view everyone compassionately, and to reconcile problems more elegantly -- to push beyond seeing issues as simply black and white. This is a terrific coming-of-age story for boys or girls that will entertain them without insulting their intelligence and make learning look (nearly) more seductive than romance. There are some intense scenes, some assassination attempts, and threats of violence. There's also a lot of hardship and loss. But it's not treated gratuitously, and the focus here is on how young people become aware of the world and develop compassion for others. Miri and her friends grapple with romance, friendship, and grave injustices, all woven together so gracefully you'll hardly notice you've just been given a pretty sophisticated lesson in politics, ethics, and class struggle.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tracy Moore","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/tracy-moore"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Palace of Stone: Princess Academy, Book 2","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/12926132-palace-of-stone","isbn":"9781619632578","datePublished":"2012-08-21","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shannon Hale","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shannon_Hale"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/princess-academy-palace-stone-book2.jpg?itok=_5xrAZFI"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Finding Serendipity","datePublished":"2015-03-09","description":"&quot;Finding Serendipity&quot; is swashbuckling fun, a pirate adventure story and literary romp rolled into one.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/finding-serendipity","reviewBody":"&quot;Finding Serendipity&quot; is swashbuckling fun, a pirate adventure story and literary romp rolled into one.

In fact, Tiny's stage directions following the song state, \"If anyone is going to object to this musical, they will have left the theater at this point.\" But those with an open mind will find a heartwarming, clever, and universal story about the growing pains of puberty and the endless search for love and meaning. There are goofy puns and silly rhymes; a few of the pop-culture jokes don't land; and the story and message are straightforward almost to the point of being too blatant. But these minor shortcomings are overwhelmingly obscured by the sheer boldness and positivity of the script. The dialogue is a perfect facsimile of stereotypical musical theater, and the use of chorus members, supporting characters, and even the ghost of Oscar Wilde give the story a dynamism that would be ideal for the stage. \nAlthough there's no music (yet), readers can imagine the show-stopping choreography and catchy melodies for themselves, adding an element of audience participation. Hold Me Closer is seemingly written for gay teens, but it's equally appealing to anyone interested in the challenges of young adulthood and self-acceptance.

In particular, they may have tired of author Catherynne M. Valente's fondness for wild images and pure delight in yanking the rug out from characters and readers alike at frequent intervals. But, although she's not going to be everyone's dish, Valente's narrator is that rare jewel: She has all this under control and dispenses assorted reassuring asides but also doesn't take herself too seriously. Which is a big part of what makes you willing to cut Valente some slack when she launches the fourth book in a five-part series by introducing a protagonist you've never heard of, and she makes you care deeply about the plight and future of &quot;The Boy Who Lost Fairyland&quot;. She dazzles you with language, cracks you up, and breaks your heart, often in the same paragraph, such as this one:\n\"Thomas Rood had a naked heart, even when the rest of him was bundled up in hats and mittens in the depths of winter. And it was this naked heart that hurled itself at everything, at lamps and toys and flagstones and draperies. Thomas could not help it. All his life he had known that something was wrong. It was only that he did not know what it was. He felt all the time as though there were another boy inside him, a bigger boy, a stronger boy, a boy who knew impossible things, a boy so wonderful he could talk to jewels and make friends with fire. But whenever he tried to let that boy out, he was only Thomas, red-faced, sputtering, gangly, clench-fist Thomas.\"","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Eisenhart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mary-eisenhart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Boy Who Lost Fairyland","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/18961361-the-boy-who-lost-fairyland","isbn":"978-1250023490","datePublished":"2015-03-03","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Catherynne M.

Generations of superheroes took the lead of the Pimpernel, who pioneered the concept of the secret identity, and a swarm of deceptively dim aristocratic detectives (such as Lord Peter Wimsey) hark back to Sir Percy. The Kinks' pop song \"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\" takes its verse form and its lyrics from the tale. The story itself is such a classic that it's being \"reimagined\" to this day.\nWhen &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; first appeared in 1905 (as a stage production; the book came out later that year), critics panned it as \"old-fashioned,\" but audiences loved it. They also loved the two movies it spawned and the numerous sequels the Baroness Orczy produced for the next 40 years. Today, it's even more old-fashioned, from its flowery language to its outmoded prejudices -- and still a riveting page-turner with constant danger, impossible ethical quandaries, a dastardly villain, a resourceful and brave hero, and determined Marguerite trying to sort it all out before it's too late.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Eisenhart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mary-eisenhart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Scarlet Pimpernel","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=OA8nAAAAMAAJ","isbn":"978-0451527622","datePublished":"1905-03-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Baroness Orczy","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Baroness_Orczy&redirect=no"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/scarletpimpernel.jpg?itok=RhgL63dd"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Alive: The Generations Trilogy, Book 1","datePublished":"2015-07-17","description":"From its claustrophobic opening to its crackerjack action climax, this thriller will keep readers guessing right to the end.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/alive-the-generations-trilogy-book-1","reviewBody":"From its claustrophobic opening to its crackerjack action climax, this thriller will keep readers guessing right to the end.

The storytelling style adds to rather than detracts from the plot and character development. Tippi and Grace take on typical teen issues, but these issues are magnified because of their medical condition. Author Sarah Crossan successfully strikes a balance between keeping the story light when needed and not veering too far into pathos and melodrama when the story takes more serious turns. Sometimes the twins' problems are amusing; for example, Tippi likes coffee and Grace doesn't, but she still has to deal with the buzz. Other concerns that are serious enough for regular teens are harder on them, such as dating, making choices about drinking and smoking, and making some important medical decisions.\nThey also grapple with a fair bit of guilt over their family's m&quot;One&quot;y troubles, their parents' problems, and their younger sister often getting ignored. Their feelings about these problems are deep and often heartrending. This could have been a cloying or shock-driven novel, but it's not. Tippi and Grace are wonderfully developed, engaging characters, and n&quot;One&quot; of the other characters is &quot;One&quot;-dimensional. The free-verse approach lets the story flow and adds detail in a beautiful way, offering up snippets that speak volumes.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Cosola","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mary-cosola"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"One","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=_bz3BQAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-0062118752","datePublished":"2015-09-15","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sarah Crossan","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/4864330.Sarah_Crossan"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/onecover.jpg?itok=_KKyQIf6"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Hired Girl","datePublished":"2015-10-05","description":"This fictional diary of a feisty, pure-hearted girl who craves self-betterment is a stunner of a novel.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-hired-girl","reviewBody":"This fictional diary of a feisty, pure-hearted girl who craves self-betterment is a stunner of a novel.

The story is Jewish, with references to lighting the menorah and humming a \"nigundl,\" but it's also ecumenical: That year, Hanukkah coincided with Christmas, so the newsstand man wishes Oskar \"Merry Christmas,\" and he's entranced by holiday shop windows. The artful writing and deft handling make the story and the blessings theme universal.\nIllustrator Mark Siegel, well known for his work in graphic novels, uses panels to illustrate the legs of the journey, and his art is as moving as the text, as when a good fairy in a shop window is reflected in Oskar's eyes. A plus for New Yorkers is the detailed depiction of the city and its neighborhoods.

A bunny, a bear, and an elephant walk into a sleepover, assisted by a little girl. They dance a chicken dance, have a funny face contest, and enjoy something good to eat (\"Nom Nom Nom.\"). When it's time for bed, they sleepwalk down the hall (\"Z Z Z\"), and the girl reads them stories, then suggests that they all say what they're thankful for, which triggers a lovely rhyme that's simple and satisfying.\nLoving references to familiar classic children's books abound. The bunny in the blue striped pajamas is lifted straight from Goodnight Moon, and his name, Clement, must refer to Clement Hurd, that book's illustrator. The bear's name, Alan Alexander, is taken from A. A. Milne, author of Winnie the Pooh, also evoked by a picture of a bear carried aloft by a balloon. And the elephant's name is Jean, \u00e0 la Jean de Brunhoff, author of Babar. It's not at all necessary to catch these references to enjoy the book, but &quot;Thank You and Good Night&quot; is squarely and happily in their classic company.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Thank You and Good Night","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=031638822X","isbn":"9780316337991","datePublished":"2015-10-06","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Patrick McDonnell","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/53088.Patrick_McDonnell"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9780316338011-p0-v1-s192x300.jpg?itok=ntUB6faG"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Little Robot","datePublished":"2015-10-30","description":"Loneliness and longing get lovely treatment in this nearly wordless book by Ben Hatke, who's created another gem of a heroine with the barefoot, nameless, wrench-wielding brown-skinned girl.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/little-robot","reviewBody":"Loneliness and longing get lovely treatment in this nearly wordless book by Ben Hatke, who's created another gem of a heroine with the barefoot, nameless, wrench-wielding brown-skinned girl.

As a little girl and her father walk home from errands, the girl finds weedy wildflowers sprouting from the cracks of the sidewalk and walls. She picks them, then distributes the flowers to others along her walk. At the start of the book, the art is mostly black and white, so the girl in her red jacket stands out, as do the delicately colored flowers she picks. But as the story progresses, illustrator Sydney Smith adds more and more color. The flowers are humble, including dandelions, underscoring the simplicity and everyday quality of the beauty.\nThe child's point of view is perfectly portrayed, as is the loving family -- the mom welcoming the girl home with a hug, and the dad patient and gentle, extending a hand for the girl to hold when she runs to catch up. The urban neighborhood is comfortably integrated, carrying an implicit message of diversity and inclusion. Friends and neighbors are people of color, and people on the sidewalk include an Asian shopkeeper and a woman in a hijab.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Sidewalk Flowers","sameAs":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details\/JonArno_Lawson_Sidewalk_Flowers?id=OUXkBgAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-1554984312","datePublished":"2015-03-17","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"JonArno Lawson","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/177113.JonArno_Lawson?from_search=true&search_version=service"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9781554984312-p0-v1-s192x300.jpg?itok=poQqgqOr"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"What We Saw","datePublished":"2015-11-05","description":"Although it's not easy to finish a story about a rape at an unsupervised high school party in a town that's basically complicit in covering up the crime, this is a powerful, must-read book.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/what-we-saw","reviewBody":"Although it's not easy to finish a story about a rape at an unsupervised high school party in a town that's basically complicit in covering up the crime, this is a powerful, must-read book. In his first novel, Hartzler, a hilarious memoirist (Rapture Practice), tackles dozens of hot-button issues, from slut-shaming and cyberbullying to male privilege and sports culture, but it never feels too much or too preachy. Kate is genuinely outraged, but she's also authentically confused about what's the right thing to do in the situation. She bravely puts herself in Stacey's shoes in a way virtually no one else, even most girls, are willing to do. Everyone's too busy thinking about the poor boys' (also known as rapists) futures to give a girl with a loose reputation a second thought.\nBy making the main character Kate instead of Stacey, Hartzler allows readers to see how we're all accountable for what happens in our midst -- how standing by in silence is an act of complicity but how speaking the truth, even when it's costly and may brand you a whistle-blower or betrayer, is an act of courage. Kate isn't perfect. She occasionally yells or retreats when she should ask questions, and she makes a decision even many readers will consider extreme. But it's in her uncompromising support of Stacey, of humanizing the girl who was raped despite what she happened to drink or wear or say the night she was assaulted, that makes Kate such a laudable character. Hartzler does a fine job chronicling Kate and Ben's attraction, so perhaps his next book will be a romantic comedy. &quot;What We Saw&quot; may be tough to read, but it stays with you, and that's what a good issue book does.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"What We Saw","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/20922826-what-we-saw","isbn":"978-0062338747","datePublished":"2015-09-22","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Aaron Hartzler","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/4719762.Aaron_Hartzler"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/20922826.jpg?itok=pynEukfA"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Most Dangerous: Daniel Ellsberg and the Secret History of the Vietnam War","datePublished":"2015-11-07","description":"Meticulously researched and clearly presented, this history of the Pentagon Papers shows how one man helped topple an American president by insisting the truth be told to the American people.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/most-dangerous-daniel-ellsberg-and-the-secret-history-of-the-vietnam-war","reviewBody":"Meticulously researched and clearly presented, this history of the Pentagon Papers shows how one man helped topple an American president by insisting the truth be told to the American people.

Author Kenneth Oppel, who wrote the equally enthralling The Boundless only a year before &quot;The Nest&quot; -- he's really on a roll -- presents a family struggling with the stress of a sick baby through the eyes of Steve, a boy whose age isn't given (but he's probably in middle school). He's anxious enough to see a therapist, washes his hands too often, and is afraid to even say the name of the family's new baby who's come into the house and may not live.\nThat in itself would be a compelling story in Oppel's hands. But then there are Steve's dreams about the wasps that are way too real. And a scary knife sharpener with missing fingers who goes door to door. And a toy telephone the little sister answers to talk to \"Mr. Nobody.\" Readers will be torn like Steve about what to believe is real and who's really on his side. The tension builds right after Steve makes a profound decision about what he stands for. And he's willing to risk his life for it. After readers close the book and the tension of the climax fades, the beautiful themes in &quot;The Nest&quot; linger. A favorite: that Steve's family will have struggles and his brother won't be perfect but he's part of the family and is loved and valued for who he is, just as Steve is loved and valued.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

Readers might think they're getting into a romance, but instead they find themselves enmeshed in a beautiful, emotional, and suspenseful novel. No character in this book is a cliche, not even minor characters, such as an ex-girlfriend of Will's who easily could have been a stereotype. The story's told mostly from Lou's viewpoint, with a few chapters from the viewpoints of other characters, with the notable exception of Will. Lou has a great voice as a character. She has a lot on her shoulders, but she's charming and funny, especially when she babbles nervously. Will is more of a cipher as he confronts major problems: confined to a wheelchair, living with pain, missing his old life, and not knowing when or how badly his condition will deteriorate. Author Jojo Moyes provides an eye-opening look at what quadriplegics have to deal with on a daily basis, physically, emotionally, and socially. Also addressed is the issue of death with dignity. That said, the book has stirred controversy for offering what some consider a stereotypical portrayal of a disabled person who feels that life's not worth living because he's disabled. \n&quot;Me Before You&quot; will move many readers to tears, but not in an overly manipulative way. In addition to the humor and emotion in the book, the suspense is gripping. Moyes doesn't telegraph the ending at all, which will have most readers on the edge of their seat.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Cosola","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mary-cosola"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Me Before You","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=ccx5BAAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-0143124542","datePublished":"2013-07-30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jojo Moyes","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jojo_Moyes"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/me-before-you-cover.jpeg?itok=_gGhqNKF"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Lost.

It explores a kid's worst fear -- the death of a parent -- and walks with 17-year-old Matt on his journey, taking a nuanced and layered approach that is raw, real, and oddly welcome. So often, books that deal with grieving young people show kids going through long periods of acting out until they reach a quick and tidy resolution. Author Jason Reynolds leaves that overdone approach behind and shows teens reacting with the same complex emotional response to death that any adult would. One can argue that Matt is even better equipped to deal with his grief because he has yet to form damaging habits that often take over a person's life during times of sorrow.\nIt's refreshing to see a contemporary novel that deals with male feelings in a way that doesn't reduce them to either overly macho or fantastically sensitive stereotypes. Reynolds shows multiple generations of men being open with their emotions and feeling OK with communicating those feelings with people close to them. Parents and teens will love this book's quick pace, complex character portrayals, and positive but realistic story line.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terreece Clarke","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/terreece-clarke"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Boy in the Black Suit","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/about\/The_Boy_in_the_Black_Suit.html?id=Jc7BAwAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-1442459502","datePublished":"2015-01-06","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jason Reynolds","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/1229281.Jason_Reynolds"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/boy-in-black-suit.jpg?itok=WKNWQZOI"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Trombone Shorty","datePublished":"2016-01-18","description":"This book is a lyrical, toe-tapping, playful, and adventurous look into the early life of musician Troy Andrews.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/trombone-shorty","reviewBody":"This book is a lyrical, toe-tapping, playful, and adventurous look into the early life of musician Troy Andrews.

For instance, when the narrator wonders if her child will \"take care of [much smaller] things,\u201d\"the complementing art includes a little blond boy with measuring tape wrapped around his shoulders sewing pants for a squirrel.\nWhile the story is mainly a vehicle for parents to express their love and hopes for their children, young readers will also enjoy the pictures of kids dressed up in fun costumes (superheroes, bears, ballerinas) trying out different roles (musician, artist, veterinarian); the recurrence of woodland and wild creatures; and the cute details.

Similar to when you watch Titanic for the first time, you know the ship is doomed but not exactly how the fictional characters will fare within that tragedy. In Joana, Emilia, and Florian, Sepetys has created three diverse characters who ultimately bond and care for each other. Once again, Sepetys adds touches of humor and romance to her history, and it works beautifully. \nThis is a book parents should read with their teens and recommend to school media specialists and English teachers. It has so much to offer teen and adult readers, and it's a perfect companion novel to Sepetys' Between Shades of Gray, set in 1941 in a Siberian forced-larbor camp. In fact, those who've read that novel will recognize one of the main characters in &quot;Salt to the Sea&quot;. By focusing on aspects of WWII that are less saturated in historical fiction, Sepetys provides readers with a way to connect to the day-to-day battle civilians had to fight on all sides. This is a story of humanity in the face of unthinkable horror, of love blossoming in the midst of hatred, of kindness turning strangers into family. Read it, talk about it, and treasure that authors like Sepetys have chosen to write specifically for young adult readers.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Salt to the Sea","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/25614492-salt-to-the-sea","isbn":"978-0399160301","datePublished":"2016-02-02","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ruta Sepetys","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ruta_Sepetys"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/25614492.jpg?itok=yYAZRf3u"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Worm Loves Worm","datePublished":"2016-02-06","description":"Love really isn't complicated, and the winsome worms in this charming story are a fine example of the joy and confidence in that simple understanding.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/worm-loves-worm","reviewBody":"Love really isn't complicated, and the winsome worms in this charming story are a fine example of the joy and confidence in that simple understanding.

Brown made her reputation writing stories that appeal to children, and her books are still wildly popular. The subject is sensitive, and the text is forthright, not touchy-feely -- the reader experiences the confusion of death from the kids' point of view and from their actions, burying the bird \"the way grown-up people did when someone died.\" When the bird's body goes cold, the plain-dealing text says, \"That was the way animals got when they had been dead for some time -- cold dead and stone still, with no heart beating.\"\nThe sadness of death is counteracted by the colorful, life-affirming art that lends the book a welcome cheer. The kids smile as they go about the business of memorializing the bird and form a happy, connected ring to sing the song they make up. They're also accompanied by a dog who's very much alive -- he licks the kids' faces when they cry -- and the group itself is happily racially diverse.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Dead Bird","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/197998.The_Dead_Bird","isbn":"978-0060289317","datePublished":"2016-03-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Margaret Wise Brown","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Margaret_Wise_Brown"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9780060289317-p0-v1-s192x300.jpg?itok=Pbw71zUN"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Thunder Boy Jr.","datePublished":"2016-05-06","description":"This surefire kid pleaser, perfect for families to share, blends detail about a Native American boy and his family with dashes of both silliness and tenderness.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/thunder-boy-jr","reviewBody":"This surefire kid pleaser, perfect for families to share, blends detail about a Native American boy and his family with dashes of both silliness and tenderness.

Perez candidly describes the heady emotional roller coaster of falling in love with the added heartache of knowing it's not only socially forbidden but illegal and dangerous. Naomi and Wash complete each other in a meaningful way, not to mention that Wash loves the precocious twins Cari and Beto, but they both know that their relationship is ultimately doomed -- especially in the confines of their small and segregated oil town.\nThe story explores real racial brutality, and the author never shies away from the town's overt racism or the mob violence that was considered acceptable -- so long as it was directed at African-Americans. Because each chapter is told from a different point of view, with Naomi and Wash having the most perspectives, Perez is able to delve fully into the psyches of even the antagonist and \"The Gang,\" the voice that stands in for the white community of students. By no means is this an easy read; at times readers may need a box of tissues to manage the emotional nature of the last third of the story.

It's no surprise that debut author Jeff Zentner is also a professional musician -- a guitarist, singer, and songwriter -- because the language is lush and lyrical, with angsty Dill in particular being a thinker of deep philosophical musings about his poisoned bloodline, his overwhelming and seemingly unrequited love for Lydia, and his changing faith. Lydia isn't perfect; she's a bit of a cultural snob who can't wait to flee to the streets of New York City with worldly young fashionistas and celebrities who follow her popular blog Dollywould (after her idol and fellow Tennesseean Dolly Parton). But she also knows how lucky she is to have found Dill and Travis and how their friendship saved her from being a lonely outcast (her professional parents are considerably more well off than most in Forrestville). Lydia's flaws make her that much more realistic, just as Travis' impressive size belies a geeky devotion to a Game of Thrones-like fandom, and a gentleness with his mama create a character who's so unique and lovable that you'll ache for him when his father hurls insults his way.  \nDespite the alternating third-person points of view among the three best friends, the title and the story ultimately belong to Dill. Plagued with a name belonging to a grandfather and a father who've both surrendered to darkness (grief in his grandfather's case; faith and child pornography in his father's case), only child Dill is crushed by the bleakness of his future. His put-upon mother demands that he take a full-time job to settle his father's considerable legal fees, making sure to assert that it's his duty to honor his parents and pay off their debts. Meanwhile, at least fanboy Travis has Amelia and his books for escape, and Lydia has a future being a young fashion maven. Dill's existential ennui and depression at the thought of losing Lydia takes up a lot of space in the story, but don't despair -- hope is there in the form of a song and a touch. Zentner's story is at times difficult to read, but even in the darkest of moments, the unconditional friendship among Dill, Lydia, and Travis is full of light, love, and laughter.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Serpent King","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/22752127-the-serpent-king","isbn":"978-1770498839","datePublished":"2016-03-08","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jeff Zentner","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/8394519.Jeff_Zentner"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/the-serpent-king.jpg?itok=WsPLoUUV"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Calamity: The Reckoners, Book 3","datePublished":"2016-03-17","description":"Superhero action usually works best with a combination of words and pictures, but this near-future thriller succeeds with vivid prose alone.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/calamity-the-reckoners-book-3","reviewBody":"Superhero action usually works best with a combination of words and pictures, but this near-future thriller succeeds with vivid prose alone.

George R. R. Martin is a master plotter, moving his huge cast of characters from one harrowing situation to the next and keeping readers anxious and surprised again and again. Some of the first five volumes work better than others (A Feast for Crows leaves many readers disappointed), but all add new elements that only increase the complex richness of the narrative.\nThis book series is certainly not for sensitive readers. The language is rough, the violence is brutal, and the sexual content sometimes veers into the perverse (including brother-sister incest). But readers with the maturity to handle adult material will be amply rewarded.

Even skeptical young adult readers should take a chance on Maggie Stiefvater's four-part masterwork, the culmination of more than 10 years of dreaming and writing that resulted in a series that gets better and better with each installment. This final volume is even more firmly rooted in the magic, the dreams, the relationships that Stiefvater has cultivated. While the twisting plot may at times feel slightly anticlimactic, it's purposeful, because this story isn't about the plot but about the characters, and the characters once again shine so brightly your heart will ache with the power of their love for one another. Yes, Blue's curse and Gansey's foretold death that Stiefvater introduces in the very first chapter of the very first book are on everyone's minds, but ultimately there's so much more to this book than whether that is true or not.\nWhat's certainly true is that each of the boys becomes a King in his own way. Blue finds out more about her past, especially her father, but it's the boys' character arcs that breathtakingly come full circle. After teasing at the Ronan-Adam connection for two books, these two at last come to terms with the obvious attraction. Early on Adam remarks that \"making Ronan Lynch smile felt as heated as making a bargain with Cabeswater,\" and in one of the book's most evocative lines Ronan says that \"his feelings for Adam were an oil spill; he'd let them overflow and now there wasn't a damn place in the ocean that wouldn't catch fire if he dropped a match.\" Of course, there are a few aspects of the book some readers will undoubtedly take issue with, such as the reintroduction of charming, rich Gansey-like Henry Cheng as a much more prominent ally and fast friend to Gansey and Blue (and eventually Ronan and Adam, since to befriend one is to befriend all). But in this case, a new (and overtly diverse) perspective helps them all and reminds them that they can indeed care about other (new) people, such as Mr. Gray or Jesse Dittley. Overall, there's so much to love about The Raven King that, despite it being unputdownable, you won't want it to end.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Raven King:  The Raven Cycle, Book 4","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/17378527-the-raven-king","isbn":"9780545424998","datePublished":"2016-04-26","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Maggie Stiefvater","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maggie_Stiefvater"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/17378527.jpg?itok=UDtyao3u"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Wolf Hollow","datePublished":"2016-04-27","description":"Lauren Wolk will invite comparison to Harper Lee thanks to this beautifully written middle grade novel.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/wolf-hollow","reviewBody":"Lauren Wolk will invite comparison to Harper Lee thanks to this beautifully written middle grade novel.

The authors diverge in their handling of the larger social issues, and in that &quot;Wolf Hollow&quot; skews to a slightly younger reader.

Anyone who's dealt with loss -- whether the death of a loved one or a parting of ways with a friend -- will relate to Cedar's difficulty reconciling her past with her future. She struggles with regret, guilt, and fear, with her faith in the everyday badly shaken.\nCedar is haunted not only by what she loved and misses about her father and brother but by what she didn't get a chance to know and will never be able to understand. Gently written but emotionally searing, this honest, quiet novel is a good starting point for conversations about life, death, and the mark we leave on those around us.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Darienne Stewart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/darienne-stewart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Summerlost","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=2RwoCgAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-0399187193","datePublished":"2016-03-29","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ally Condie","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ally_Condie"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/summerlost-book.jpg?itok=9I4mmFyk"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"As Brave As You","datePublished":"2016-05-03","description":"","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/as-brave-as-you","reviewBody":"Endearing, relevant, and enthralling, this novel offers a glimpse into the lives of one family in the lazy days of summer and captures the natural shifting dynamic that occurs in families over time. The boys rely on each other when the grown-up world gets to be too much, and their relationship and Genie's openness help the family to heal long-standing rifts. Author Jason Reynolds is a master storyteller. He creates characters that are so real, readers forget they don't actually know Genie, Ernie, and their grandfather.\nReynolds is not afraid to dig into topics others shy away from, yet somehow, in &quot;As Brave As You&quot;, he balances the weight of those topics with the natural lightheartedness of youth. Genie's character and his observations are funny and insightful and straddle the line between precociousness and typical 11-year-old (mis)understandings.

At the water fountain, the school sprays a kid who says, \"I hate school,\" but then the school feels bad about it.  At lunch, one kid squirts milk out of his nose, and the school thinks, \"Now I'm covered with nose milk.\" And the only real threat comes from some older kids who look bored and say things like, \"This place stinks.\"\nThe school, Frederick Douglass Elementary (\"That's a good name for me,\" thought the school), has a seamlessly integrated student body, and, as with most adjustments, it's a friend who helps most.

The plot is unputdownable: a mix of emotional coming-of-age revelations plus the intense realities and horrors of WWII and the riveting central mystery of what happened to Mirjam. Readers will feel compelled to keep going, as Hannie digs herself deeper into the dangerous waters of resistance work, discovering exactly what's happening at Amsterdam's legendary Schouwburg Theater, which imprisons Dutch Jews awaiting deportation. When she first walks into the Schouwburg, with memories of the last time she saw a show there, she's immediately overwhelmed by the terrifying reality of what the Nazis are doing.\nAlthough there are definitely painful and disturbing passages, the author's prose is crisp and accessible to younger readers. The language is artful without being flowery, and the plot is layered without being convoluted. Even adult readers will learn a great deal about the Dutch role in the war as an occupied country with a mostly Aryan populace the Nazis felt could be assimilated into German culture. Hesse contextualizes various aspects of Dutch responses to the war, from the young woman who falls in love and marries a Nazi (and therefore betters her station) to the black market smugglers to the onderduikers and student resistance workers who did everything from help people go into hiding to try to save Jewish children by having them secretly adopted by well-meaning gentiles. This is the ideal book for a parent-child read-along, an extracurricular book club, summer school reading, or simply the pleasure of a book that entertains, expands your horizons, and teaches you all at once.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Girl in the Blue Coat","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/26030682-girl-in-the-blue-coat","isbn":"978-0316260602","datePublished":"2016-04-05","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Monica Hesse","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/5768028.Monica_Hesse"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/girl-in-the-blue-coat-opt.jpg?itok=xJAqhoYt"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Saving the Whole Wide World: Hilo, Book 2","datePublished":"2016-06-27","description":"Building on the strong series start, this second volume is even more action packed, fun filled, and ridiculously goofy than Book 1.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/saving-the-whole-wide-world-hilo-book-2","reviewBody":"Building on the strong series start, this second volume is even more action packed, fun filled, and ridiculously goofy than Book 1.

And Vada's rough relationship with her much milder brother Radu, and with the future sultan Mehmed, are at the center of the story.\nWhite digs deep into their longings for connection, for homeland, and even for religion.

It takes a year for the dads to adopt. Lester's neediness persists, trying the family, and Daddy Albert, who can be loving and supportive, has a fiery temper. But Williams is deft at the touching detail. When the dads make cocoa for Lester in the wee hours, and when Lester playfully rams his head into Daddy Rich's belly, we know these humans are trying their best to forge a family and are lucky to have found each other.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Home at Last","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0061349739","isbn":"978-0061349737","datePublished":"2016-09-13","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Vera B.

One can imagine &quot;A Child of Books&quot; gaining cult status, with book- and art-loving fifth-graders slipping it out of their backpacks to share with like-minded friends. Author-illustrator Oliver Jeffers teamed up with fine artist Winston, who used printed text from classic children's books to create the settings and backgrounds traveled by the Jeffers-drawn characters. Younger kids can enjoy the story at face value, while older kids familiar with the classics will have fun noting how Winston worked with the texts thematically, using books about ocean journeys -- The Swiss Family Robinson and Kidnapped -- to create the sea and text from Frankenstein to make up his monster.\nThe endpapers list the numerous classics incorporated, ranging from novels such as The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Black Beauty to beloved fairy tales.

Ghost is the kind of story readers carve out time for because they won't want to put it down. Students and parents alike will easily identify with Castle as he navigates middle school with heavy adult concerns on his shoulders. Even though he comes across as tough, Castle is highly observant and sensitive to the personalities and circumstances around him, which can lead to him becoming overwhelmed by situations he faces throughout the book. His learning how to focus and channel those emotions is a large part of what makes the story successful.\nTwo things that stand out in addition to Castle's wit and acute understanding of human nature: the multiple opportunities he has for mentorship and the positive peer pressure he gets from all sides as he moves to outrun his anger and the ghosts of his past. This makes the relationships and story that much more dynamic and rich.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terreece Clarke","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/terreece-clarke"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Ghost: Track, Book 1","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/28954126-ghost","isbn":"9781481450164","datePublished":"2016-08-30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jason Reynolds","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/1229281.Jason_Reynolds"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/ghost.png?itok=MnZ51sPt"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Class","datePublished":"2016-08-12","description":"","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-class","reviewBody":"There's a sweet, homey feel to this book as it follows 20 kids with a range of recognizable personality types as they get ready for their first day of school, some with excitement, some with jitters.

Though he wasn't credited publicly for many years and never got to perform the surgery himself, his groundbreaking contribution was eventually acknowledged.\nColin Bootman's vivid, realistic, artful illustrations give kids a feel for Thomas' era as well as the science.

Tahir's smartest decision is to give Helene narrating duties, and it her character that most \"makes\" A Torch Against the Night such a layered and compelling read. Yes, Laia and Elias are still the main characters, but the story's One True Pairing has a lot to overcome, and the romance (at least between them) takes a backseat to the more practical matters of survival, escape, and the need to break Darin out of the Empire's most notorious prison. It's Helene who is left behind to deal with her own existential crisis about duty, personal sacrifice for public good, and whether to follow a leader she vowed to serve but finds morally despicable.\nThe magical elements that were hinted at in the first book grow in this installment. Not only does Helene still possess the power to heal, but Elias discovers he can travel between the world of the living and the purgatory-like place that the dead who aren't ready to move on inhabit. And Laia -- well, she has her own talents. There's an even greater villain than the commandant. If she's Darth Vader (hey, she's Elias' birth mom so the comparison works), this villain is the emperor, but an even creepier one that can disguise his true nature. A Torch Against the Night is the kind of adventure fantasy that should appeal to all genre readers, but the romantic tension does increase, and shippers should enjoy the dynamic that a certain new Mask serving under Helene brings to the equation of future possibilities. All readers will benefit from the fierceness of the female characters and Tahir's ability to thoughtfully insert issues of class, race, and injustice in this unputdownable series.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"A Torch Against the Night: An Ember in the Ashes, Book 2","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/25558608-a-torch-against-the-night","isbn":"978-1101998878","datePublished":"2016-08-30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sabaa Tahir","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/7770873.Sabaa_Tahir"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/atorchagainstthenight.jpg?itok=SIFl6kkn"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"We Found a Hat","datePublished":"2016-10-07","description":"This sly and sweet third picture book in Jon Klassen's hat trilogy gets at the thorny question of what to do when there's only one thing and two friends both want it.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/we-found-a-hat","reviewBody":"This sly and sweet third picture book in Jon Klassen's hat trilogy gets at the thorny question of what to do when there's only one thing and two friends both want it. In the first two books, the bear appeared to eat the bunny and it seemed the big fish ate the little fish -- unusually edgy conclusions for picture books. But in &quot;We Found a Hat&quot;, the conflict isn't life-threatening, and kids will identify with the turtle whose gaze keeps shifting back as he contemplates sneaking back to get it when his rival drifts to sleep. Readers might wonder if the turtles could share, but Klassen envisions a dreamier solution in which each turtle happily gets its own hat.\nThere's very little text, divided up into three sections, and sepia-tinged art jibes with the desert setting.

Three Dark Crowns will take an effort for some readers to piece together, as each queen's story is told separately. We meet Katharine first in a house full of Poisoners who regularly indulge in tainted banquets. Sickly from the lack of the immunity her gift should provide but still desperate to please, she gives off the creepiest vibe. Arsinoe takes longer to reach the same dark place; the desperate queen is slowly coerced into some shady magic practices to compensate for her weak gift. As for Mirabella, it's the bloodthirsty, cunning priestesses who add a delicious level of dark.\nEach of the rites and rituals the queens endure -- the birthday parties, the festival of Beltane, the selection of the suitors, the Quickening -- are expertly woven into the story. Readers get the slow reveal of just what these doomed queens are up against. Will you root for the survival of one queen the way the towns do? For the small chance in this macabre world that mercy will rule out in the end? Even a reader's allegiance may shift with the cliffhanger at the end.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

Instead, The Things We Carried begs the reader to question the very nature of life, death, and survival. Not only does the book engage with the invisible scars of battle and the PTSD that results from combat, but it also alludes to the destructive psychology of nationalism and imperialism and the folly of concepts such as valor, honor, and truth. In a passage early on, the narrator declares, \"In war you lose your sense of the definite, hence your sense of truth itself, and therefore it's safe to say that in a true war story nothing is ever absolutely true.\" \nThe writing is blunt but vivid, deep but relatable, concise but somehow expansive. O'Brien's writings (including the memoir If I Die in a Combat Zone and the novel Going After Cacciato) are considered essential to the Vietnam War canon for a reason. And &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; is a perfect example of how literature can add to our understanding of history when it engages authentically with the people who lived through the events being discussed.

Isabel returns to narrate the last installment of Ashes: The Seeds of America Trilogy, and she's admirable and relatable as a young woman struggling to find her place in strange, new circumstances where nothing is guaranteed and nothing can be taken for granted -- not even bonds of family, love, and friendship.\nTweens and middle schoolers will relate to messages about knowing how and when to choose a side, or when to follow your own path, and about how to open yourself up to the risks that come with loving someone. The plot keeps the pages turning, and the story is richly embroidered with fascinating details about both everyday life and the larger events of the Revolutionary War as it comes to an end. There's also plenty of food for thought about slavery's effect on the very beginnings of our nations, and kids can be encouraged to think about how those beginnings continue to reverberate today.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Beach","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/andrea-beach"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Ashes:  The Seeds of America Trilogy, Book 3","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=sb7VAQAAQBAJ&dq=ashes+laurie+halse+anderson&source=gbs_navlinks_s","isbn":"978-1416961468","datePublished":"2016-10-04","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Laurie Halse Anderson","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Laurie_Halse_Anderson"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/ashes.jpg?itok=izI1S9Od"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"When the Moon Was Ours","datePublished":"2016-10-17","description":"This beautifully written romance is a magical fairy tale about best friends who fall in love in a poignant, honest, and life-altering way.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/when-the-moon-was-ours","reviewBody":"This beautifully written romance is a magical fairy tale about best friends who fall in love in a poignant, honest, and life-altering way. Author Anna-Marie McLemore, a finalist for the American Library Association's William C. Morris YA Debut Award for her first novel, Weight of Feathers, outdoes herself with her second book. The novel features an atypical couple with an authenticity that stems from the author's own first-love-turned-marriage with a trans man. But even before you get to the author's note, where she lovingly explains all of that, readers will be swept up by the story and captivated by how McLemore weaves the ordinary in with the extraordinary. The entitled, clannish, and self-destructive Bonner sisters who truly believe everyone should either fall in love with them or at the very least do as they say are like The Virgin Suicides' Lisbon sisters meets the Mean Girls Plastics' clique.\nDespite their years of friendship and love, Miel and Sam's evolving relationship doesn't always come up roses. They both have major identity issues to deal with, and they don't necessarily know what to say or how to say it. McLemore includes nuanced supporting characters for both Miel (Aracely, her big-sister-like guardian, a curandera -- healer -- who cures lovesickness) and Sam (his mom, who moved to their small town years earlier so a young Sam could live as a boy). Sam's gender identity is inspired by the Afghani tradition of bacha posh -- a fascinating practice in which parents with only daughters would raise one as a son until the child was past adolescence and ready for marriage. Regardless of what Sam keeps hidden, he undeniably loves Miel so much he hangs moons for her. She, in turn, would do anything to keep him safe. Richly told and unique, &quot;When the Moon Was Ours&quot; is an enchanting and unforgettable read.

It also prompts them to \"find\" our various \"grandmothers\" as they develop along our family tree. The information in the book can be read at different levels, depending on a kid's age or science knowledge. An extensive section of back matter provides lots more information for parents to share and discuss when kids are ready. \nThe tone is entirely inviting, to adults as well as kids, and the cheerful illustrations by Karen Lewis are completely kid-friendly.

Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle is a throwback to an earlier age when kids were free to roam their neighborhoods and hang out at the home of a woman living alone -- the wife of a dead pirate! She's a favorite because she's something of a big kid herself, never too grown-up to get down on the floor with them and play. What kids wouldn't love someone who lets them dig up her yard in search of buried treasure? The behavior \"cures\" found in the &quot;Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle Series&quot; are palatable because, at heart, she loves and understands the kids, and her guidance allows kids to take their behavior to absurd and therefore very funny lengths.\nMany of the characters have seriously silly names, like Mrs. Wingsproggle and Mrs. Crankminor, or highfalutin' ones like Paraphernalia and Pergola.

It shifts gears when Reuben heads toward the lighthouse to figure out the watch's secrets. Enter Penny and her eccentric family who run the lighthouse. If you've read author Trenton Lee Stewart's Mysterious Benedict Society, you know how great he is at developing eccentric characters. Reuben's refusal to trust them right away makes for the slowest part of the book.\nIt takes some real nail-biting danger to get Reuben to come around and find his partners in crime. Penny is the perfect predictable sidekick, and her devil-may-care brother Jack is a wonderful surprise. Even as the conclusion fills with booby traps and some major sleuthing genius, the story stays just as thoughtful. We get to feel for the loneliness of the enemy, the Smoke, through Reuben's eyes as he tours the Smoke's home. We ponder along with Reuben what the power he holds can do in the wrong hands. &quot;The Secret Keepers&quot; is one of those books you can read multiple times and still discover a new layer.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

Readers (and their parents) will love the casual neighborhood vibe set against the trials of Troy's life. Author Christine Kendall brings normalcy to a series of extraordinary circumstances in the life of a typical city kid as he learns some great life lessons while caring for horses and learning the sport of polo. \nOne thing Kendall does well is allow characters of various ages and genders to act as a moral compass for the main character. It's heartening to read a story that doesn't stick to the narrative of a lonely street kid with no adults or peers available for positive influence and guidance. It's also nice to bring a rural activity -- horse husbandry -- and an elite sport -- polo -- into an urban setting.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terreece Clarke","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/terreece-clarke"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Riding Chance","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/29241310-riding-chance","isbn":"978-0545924047","datePublished":"2016-10-11","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Christine Kendall","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/15017637.Christine_Kendall"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/ridingchance.jpg?itok=uayCDUmY"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Girl in Pieces","datePublished":"2016-10-28","description":"Gritty, raw, and real, Charlie Davis' story of self-harm and recovery will alternately gut and charm you.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/girl-in-pieces","reviewBody":"Gritty, raw, and real, Charlie Davis' story of self-harm and recovery will alternately gut and charm you. In &quot;Girl in Pieces&quot;, author Kathleen Glasgow draws on her own history of cutting to weave a realistic, empathetic look at what goes on in the minds of people who self-harm. The story is well balanced. Even though the subject matter is heavy, Glasgow always keeps a spark of hope in the pages. All the characters -- even the minor ones -- are well-drawn and complicated people, which makes the reader invested in the story and the outcome. Some of the passages are rough going, especially when Charlie is recounting her life on the streets or when she starts to fall into old habits, but Glasgow's beautiful writing keeps the story from being too depressing.\nIn addition to the topic of self-harm, &quot;Girl in Pieces&quot; paints an unflinching but empathetic portrayal of people dealing with loss and substance abuse. Issues around what it means to be an enabler figure strongly into the story, too. Charlie is a relatable, interesting narrator who struggles to make a new life but doesn't fall into annoying self-pity. The book is on the long side and would have benefited from more details about Charlie's backstory with her mom and dad, but her journey will stay with readers long after they've finished the book.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Cosola","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mary-cosola"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Girl in Pieces","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=5bRQCwAAQBAJ","isbn":"9781101934746","datePublished":"2016-08-30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kathleen Glasgow","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/13479611.Kathleen_Glasgow"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/girlinpiecescover.jpg?itok=NwAQ7ydZ"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Preaching to the Chickens: The Story of Young John Lewis","datePublished":"2016-10-28","description":"This is a cute, funny, sweet, beautifully illustrated look at the early childhood of Rep.

In &quot;The Bossier Baby&quot; the older sib goes to great lengths to recapture his family's attention. In one startling funny spread, he strips off his onesie outside and pees on a fence post. The accompanying text is understated and droll, stating that no one paid attention to him: \"No matter what he did. Where he did it. Or how outrageous it was.\" This is where older kids might guffaw loudly, just wishing they could strip down and let loose.\nAs in the first book, Frazee wrings humor from corporate lingo -- \"business plan\" and \"restructure the organization\" -- and draws visual inspiration from mid-century modern d\u00e9cor. This time, the parents relax with martinis and the baby keeps notes on an Etch A Sketch. Once again, warmth and connection win out as the suddenly affectionate little sister holds her arms up to her big brother and he picks her up.

The characters aren't at all complex and the names in the series are clues themselves (any kid named \"Bugs Meany\" or \"Lefty Dobbs\" is bound to be trouble), and there's humor in that simplicity. There isn't a lot of diversity in Idaville, but the series does try to expand gender roles a bit -- a girl playing football or having a better left hook than any boy.

It's no wonder, then, that the whip-smart, geeky banter that Daniel and Natasha share is adorable one moment and intensely soulful the next. They communicate like two people who have known each other for years, even though they're at the start of something undeniably special. Yoon alternates points of view between the two leads and occasionally inserts other perspectives from supporting characters who intersect with Daniel and Natasha during their time together. Those asides might have been a distraction, but they actually enhance and enrich the story and add layers to characterization.\nThe odds are stacked against our central couple due to their fundamental differences -- not only their cultural ones but their personalities. She's a realist; he's a dreamer. She thinks love is just a series of chemicals that create temporary feelings of arousal and intimacy, while he believes in fate and soulmates and two people -- them, in particular -- being \"meant to be.\" What else but fate, he suggests, could've led to their meet-cute and subsequent coincidences that brought them together? But despite their many differences, these two are both outsiders from immigrant families. They're at odds with their parents and struggle to be true to themselves. They find something in each other that sparks a sense of safety, happiness, and ultimately love -- even if their future together is uncertain.

This story also has a distinctly contemporary feel. Tiny Clementine has a buoyant spirit, as does the text. \"Most of the time, it was fun to be tiny.\" And though she's never daunted by the challenges of her size, she's determined to communicate her needs, making her a perfect role model for girls.\nAuthor-illustrator Harriet Muncaster has loads of fun picturing tiny, tenacious Clementine next to her looming toys, giving kids plenty to inspect visually.

In &quot;Christmas in the Barn&quot;, Brown uses her full arsenal of kids' book know-how to tell the story of the birth in the manger, mesmerizing readers with rhyme and repetition. She also adds to the classic feel by seamlessly weaving in fragments of lyrics kids will recognize from well-known Christmas carols, for instance, \"Away in a manger, no crib for his bed.\" The story talks about, but does not name, the human characters -- Mary, Joseph, Jesus, and the Wise Men -- and draws in young readers by emphasizing all the animals present at the cr\u00e8che scene.\nThe art, by another beloved children's book creator, Anna Dewdney, is rendered in oil paint that evokes the dusty desert landscape in which the babe was born. Mary, Joseph, and Jesus are pictured with somewhat darker skin, though one might wish they looked more clearly and consistently Middle Eastern.

Put it all together and the story moves like a brushfire from teen flirting to Western barroom brawl to scientific discovery to Sioux raids and back. All that in just over 350 pages with not a word wasted.\nThe only time the reader may have to slow down and catch a breath: when the narrator changes abruptly between Rachel and Samuel. While it's great to know both perspectives, with so much going on it's hard to keep up with more than one narrator. A small quibble in an otherwise all-around great read.

In &quot;Introducing Teddy: A Gentle Story About Gender and Friendship&quot;, author Jessica Walton wisely assigns the issue to a teddy bear, not a human, therefore keeping it at a more comfortable remove. She also peoples the book with kid characters who aren't concerned at all with gender stereotypes -- Errol likes tea parties and Ava builds robots -- so the book gently models breaking out of constricting gender roles more generally.\nThe appealing art by Dougal MacPherson goes a long way toward helping kids relate. It pictures the teddy with endearingly ragged stitching, conveying the implicit message that we all have our own secret worries and fears. This book works well for kids thinking about gender identity, or who, like most preschoolers, like to play with both trucks and tutus themselves.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Introducing Teddy: A Gentle Story About Gender and Friendship","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=168119211X","isbn":"978-1681192109","datePublished":"2016-05-31","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jessica Walton","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/14530580.Jess_Walton"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/51ue1eio2dl-sy498-bo1204203200.jpg?itok=Pwyep5m4"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Antoinette","datePublished":"2016-12-24","description":"This combo of cute, rambunctious pups and scenic, sophisticated Paris is a fun one, with messages about persistence, bravery, and discovering your strengths.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/antoinette","reviewBody":"This combo of cute, rambunctious pups and scenic, sophisticated Paris is a fun one, with messages about persistence, bravery, and discovering your strengths.

After the prequel, Clariel, was slow to ramp up, readers may expect the same here, but Goldenhand motors along right away. Chapters go back and forth between the rescue of Nick by Lirael (and the satisfying start of a romantic subplot) and the fevered pursuit of a tough new character named Ferin. She proves relentless as shaman-controlled Free Magic creatures and necromancer-raised gore crows and dead hands creep closer in every chapter.\nStrong female characters rule in the whole series, and each one is very different, from the formerly shy and sensitive Lirael to the frank and fierce Ferin. And the story is well balanced among their heroic character arcs, the exploration of the mystery of Old Kingdom magic, and the intense action of chases and battles. Here's hoping more trips to the Old Kingdom are in store for readers.  ","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

In the hands of a less-skilled writer, &quot;A Crack in the Sea&quot; might've churned into an indistinct mush, but H. M. Bouwman maintains confident control as she weaves in one thread then another, and takes us on various journeys. The characters are deliberately multiracial -- the Raftworlders are black, the island folk have skin that's lighter brown, and the boat people are Vietnamese. Some are relatably insecure, some have magical powers, and all are plucky. And though the second world is an enviably peaceful place where folks of different races respect and care for one another, it's not without conflict and challenges. And the book has plenty of page-turning suspense from the historical fiction, in which readers can learn about the slave trade and the fall of Saigon.\nStriking black-and-white illustrations by Yuko Shimizu are strategically placed and go a long way toward helping readers envision this enchanting sea world and its appealingly multiracial cast of characters. Though one might wish the art were better showcased on a more weighty, less muddy paper stock. Readers from our care-worn world will want to travel to the magical second world, and this book provides the portal.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"A Crack in the Sea","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0399545204","isbn":"9780399545214","datePublished":"2017-01-03","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"H.

It focuses on Basquiat's early influences and his laser focus on and devotion to his work, and it carries a strong emotional tug. Though the family wasn't well-off, it was rich in art, thanks to Basquiat's mom, who made sure her son had plenty of arts enrichment and lots of opportunity to draw. Author\/illustrator Javaka Steptoe chooses just the right, accessible detail. In a small but poignant moment, the mom sits on the floor and \"draws with Jean-Michel on his father's old work papers.\" So we feel Basquiat's heartbreaking loss when she has to leave the family.\nSteptoe's illustrations, made of mixed media with found objects on wood, explode with color and detail and collage elements, underlining the message that art doesn't have to be neat or stay inside the lines to be beautiful. Steptoe explains that he did this to invite readers \"to create using the materials, people, and places in their environment.\" The book feels like one big riotous creative explosion -- Basquiat's and Steptoe's for sure -- but the underlying message is that readers, too, can express themselves and create freely.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Radiant Child: The Story of Young Artist Jean-Michel Basquiat","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0316394327","isbn":"978-0316213882","datePublished":"2016-10-25","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Javaka Steptoe","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/158005.Javaka_Steptoe"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/615du1rzmtl-sx418-bo1204203200.jpg?itok=PMDRcSqx"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"I Survived Series","datePublished":"2016-01-04","description":"Since we already know that each of these disasters is, well, a disaster, the beauty of these books is in the enthralling storytelling.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/i-survived-series","reviewBody":"Since we already know that each of these disasters is, well, a disaster, the beauty of these books is in the enthralling storytelling.

The Youngest Marcher, while dealing with a very serious subject and time in U.S. history, is lighthearted at points, gets serious, and then recovers -- much like a resilient child.

Author Margot Lee Shetterly excels at providing historical context, and since she wrote this version of the book for young readers, she's careful to explain information that might be familiar to adults. For instance, she provides a list of ways blacks and whites were kept separate under segregation laws and explains that in World War II the Germans \"were fighting on the other side of the war.\"\nShetterly also takes her job as historian seriously and doesn't overly spice the story by attributing unverifiable thoughts or dialogue to the women; the sources for all dialogue are credited at the end of the book. This might make the material a bit drier in places than kid readers are used to, so the book and film could enrich each other with pairing.

Author-illustrator Jon Agee has a way with fun books for young kids, and though &quot;Life on Mars&quot; convincingly depicts a desolate Mars scape, it also manages to be sweet and funny. The boy astronaut tells the story, and his first-person voice is kid-like and appealing. Would it have been more adventurous if Agee had cast the little astronaut as someone other than a Caucasian boy? Yes, but the boy's face is sweetly expressive, making it easy for us to like him. The same goes for the big, huggable martian, who looks more shy than threatening and seems to also hope for a friend.\nKids love to feel in on the joke and will find it hysterically funny that they can see the martian looming in the background closely following the main character, while the boy himself remains clueless. The text is conversational and inviting, and there's much to search for in the art.

Juana &amp; Lucas by author-illustrator Juana Medina is narrated by a schoolgirl from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, a likable, relatable character who's strong-willed and funny. Juana's life in Bogot\u00e1 isn't so different from middle-class life in the U.S., and the story's full of cozy foreign detail. For instance, though Bogot\u00e1's temperate by day, it's colder at night, \"so everyone always keeps a pair of slippers by their bed.\"\nMedina displays a lyrical touch when conveying her love of the city. Looking out at the lights at night \"looks as if the city is wrapped in a blanket of stars.\" She's also funny, pulling some information directly from the narrative to illustrate Juana's strong opinions about topics that range from why she hates her uniform to why she loves her dog, Lucas, and her enviably big web of friends and family. Much of the humor stems from her trying to learn a foreign language. When her teacher tells the class they're going to learn \"the English,\" Juana gets a paper cut and cries out, \"Ayayay!,\" but the teacher corrects her: \" ... in English it's Ouch!\" This inviting book gives readers a very happy glimpse of a young girl's life in a cosmopolitan Latin American city.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Juana & Lucas","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0763672084","isbn":"9781536206395","datePublished":"2016-09-27","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Juana Medina","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/8319333.Juana_Medina"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/51hxg6xduwl-sx391-bo1204203200.jpg?itok=m3uhd6jW"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Anna Dressed in Blood","datePublished":"2016-01-04","description":"Reading this gory haunted house\/ghost hunter tale full of hip characters and creepy magic, you can't help imagining it as a movie you'd want to watch over and over every Halloween.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/anna-dressed-in-blood","reviewBody":"Reading this gory haunted house\/ghost hunter tale full of hip characters and creepy magic, you can't help imagining it as a movie you'd want to watch over and over every Halloween. Or picturing yourself reciting scenes form it aloud by a campfire. Main character Cas has the confident attitude about ghost hunting you'll find in Anthony Lockwood from Jonathan Stroud's fabulous Lockwood &amp; Co. series mixed with the kind of hip vibe you find in the ghost series Shades of London by Maureen Johnson. If you're drawn to either of those series and the occasional slasher film, &quot;Anna Dressed in Blood&quot; will be a huge thrill.\nAuthor Kendare Blake (Three Dark Crowns) builds her story so efficiently that readers are hunting ghosts with Cas on page one. She fills in the backstory of Cas' father's death -- doing the same dangerous job, of course -- without every slowing the story down. She also builds on her secondary characters, starting with a few cliches -- Carmel, the Queen Bee -- and then surprises us with their hidden depth. The only thing not as much a surprise as Blake may have hoped: There's something's in the attic. Waiting. The cat knew, so most readers will, too.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

All the narrators are equally as compelling, whether it's figuratively orphaned Ruth, who doesn't know how to handle a personal crisis when her grandmother treats her like she's invisible; dancing Alyce, who saves Sam only to realize he's saved her as well; angry, bitter Dora, who gets lucky with a bet but has no idea what she'd use the money for when all she wants is to be a full part of Dumpling's family; and strong, determined Hank, who just wants to keep his little brothers safe and away from their mother's boyfriend. At times it's obvious how the stories overlap, but other times it's a sweet surprise.\nAuthor Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock suggests that above all else, Alaskans are humble, frugal, unassuming people who work hard and don't draw unnecessary attention to themselves. In one early and terrible scene, Ruth's grandmother chops off her beautiful long blond hair after she vainly replies to a compliment with \"I'm pretty all over.\" In the hierarchy of sins, vanity is at the top to Alaskans like Ruth and Lily's Gran. Perhaps that's the reason why Hitchcock's writing is beautiful but economical -- no flowery or purple prose, only gorgeous and to-the-point sentences. One almost wishes for an epilogue to ensure that these poor, thoughtful, caring kids get a happy future, but the glimpse of happiness is enough; anything more would be an indulgence.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Smell of Other People's Houses","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/19370304-the-smell-of-other-people-s-houses","isbn":"978-0553497786","datePublished":"2016-02-23","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/19370304-the-smell-of-other-people-s-houses"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/smell-of-other-peoples-houses.jpg?itok=9SyXNIKp"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Midnight Without a Moon","datePublished":"2017-01-30","description":"Linda Williams Jackson's debut offers an irresistible, compelling heroine in 13-year-old Rose, growing up in a sharecropper family in Mississippi at the dawn of the civil rights era.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/midnight-without-a-moon","reviewBody":"Linda Williams Jackson's debut offers an irresistible, compelling heroine in 13-year-old Rose, growing up in a sharecropper family in Mississippi at the dawn of the civil rights era.

There are layers to the story that readers will understand as they mature; the nuances of immigration, and Papa's acceptance that prayers will be heard whether they're said in English or Hebrew is a subtle acknowledgement that life is always changing. These sweet, enthralling books are full of kindness and family love, and they give a glimpse into a world that is both 100 years old and still relevant today.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie Kingsley","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/carrie-kingsley"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"All-of-a-Kind Family Series","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/7926.All_of_a_Kind_Family?from_search=true","isbn":"978-0440400592","datePublished":"1984-12-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sydney Taylor","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/search?q=sydney+taylor"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/all-of-a-kind-family-pic.jpg?itok=mTcxLh2u"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Keith Haring: The Boy Who Just Kept Drawing","datePublished":"2017-02-19","description":"This biography does a great job of portraying Haring as a joyous, passionate, bighearted artist, very relatable to quirky, artistic kids.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/keith-haring-the-boy-who-just-kept-drawing","reviewBody":"This biography does a great job of portraying Haring as a joyous, passionate, bighearted artist, very relatable to quirky, artistic kids.

It emphasizes Haring's commitment to public work, highlighting projects that were for or involved kids, though it might have added even more depth if it had presented him more explicitly as a gay role model and touched on the savvy ways he was able to use his art in his activism.\nRobert Neubecker's exuberant illustrations hit all the right notes, incorporating Haring's own art, communicating Haring's appealing presence, and conveying the energetic diversity of New York City. The book ends with an afterword and an index of art that includes the pieces he did as a kid, carrying the implicit message that kids' art is important, as worthy as work displayed in galleries.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Keith Haring: The Boy Who Just Kept Drawing","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0525428194","isbn":"978-0525428190","datePublished":"2017-02-14","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kay A.

Griffin is a thoughtful, fabulously flawed protagonist, one who never stopped loving Theo, his best friend and first love. And Griffin doesn't know how he's supposed to grieve Theo when Jackson is in the picture. Jackson may have been dating Theo, but in Griffin's heart of hearts, he believes -- knows -- that he and Theo, not Theo and Jackson, were \"endgame.\" Once Griffin and Jackson begin commiserating -- and jointly shutting others out of their shared pain -- it's clear that things are a bit too intense, that they both have secrets about Theo the other won't want to hear. Yet as a reader, you just want these boys to heal, no matter how destroyed they might feel.\nSilvera does a beautiful job exploring the depths of Griffin's burdens, sadness, and insecurities. You feel the pain alongside Wade as Griffin unfairly keeps him out of the circle of trust, even though Wade lost a best friend, too, and even though Wade is steadfastly \"Team Griffin.\" It's a complicated thing to stay best friends after being much more, and the story requires readers to have an emotional maturity about relationships or to at least recognize what's healthy and what's unhealthy in a romantic vs. platonic relationship. Silvera packs a lot of substantive issues into this tale -- sexuality, mental illness, grief, friendship, parent-child closeness, disability -- and it's all dealt with in a nuanced, thought-provoking way that will stay with readers.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"History Is All You Left Me","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/30102870-history-is-all-you-left-me","isbn":"978-1616956929","datePublished":"2017-01-17","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Adam Silvera","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=Adam+Silvera"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/history-is-all-you-left-me.jpeg?itok=m62Y8dNX"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"City of Saints & Thieves","datePublished":"2017-02-27","description":"Readers looking for an exciting read with some extra thematic depth will be entranced by this thriller.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/city-of-saints-thieves","reviewBody":"Readers looking for an exciting read with some extra thematic depth will be entranced by this thriller.

In &quot;The Someday Birds&quot;, author Sally J. Pla creates a memorable narrator who has more quirks than even he can catalog. And Charlie is a cataloguer of many things -- birds being his main preoccupation. Clean bathrooms, chicken nuggets, names he has been called, and strange smells also make the list. The lovely thing about Pla's writing is that Charlie's abnormality is perfectly normal to him. He struggles to maintain acceptable behavior, knowing that he will be ridiculed for any outbursts. But he grows, and readers are privy to that growth without getting hit over the head by it. When Charlie's dad is transferred from San Diego to a hospital in Virginia, Charlie finds himself on the ride of his life. His siblings are on their own rides as well, growing in their own ways.\nIt's a colorful story with plot twists that are incredible, yet believable. What surprises the most is that at its heart, &quot;The Someday Birds&quot; is very much about the effects of war. All of the characters in the book have been touched by it. Though war happens somewhere else, or in a different time, its reach is felt. Survival is a theme here, and beyond that thriving as a unique member of a group provides a thrumming message of hope. Like a harbinger of spring flitting through a gray sky, &quot;The Someday Birds&quot; is a welcome arrival.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Joly Herman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/joly-herman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Someday Birds","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/26800718-the-someday-birds","isbn":"0062445766","datePublished":"2017-01-24","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sally J.

She's naive enough to not always understand exactly why the adults around her behave the way they do, particularly when it comes to romantic entanglements, but she has the maturity to understand how they're feeling.

Butler's 1979 sci-fi novel, which is intense, heart-stopping, thought-provoking, and powerful, Damian Duffy boils Butler's work down to 240 pages while not losing any of the strife, terror, ambiguity, and movement of the original. It's tough to take on a widely acclaimed and deeply loved work, and Duffy has done it splendidly, making the story come alive in a different art form. \nIllustrator John Jennings brings intricate, layered, and at times deliberately heavy, dazed, and frazzled-feeling illustrations to Butler's work, allowing readers another deeply emotional connection to the story and Dana's experiences. Jennings' art increases the intensity for readers. Some passages feel like a gut punch to the soul. There's much to unpack in the story: Duffy's adaptation, Jennings' use of color, and the science-fiction, Afrofuturistic, feminist, and racial aspects of the book. Duffy and Jennings have opened a new generation's eyes to Butler's work while encouraging Butler's fans to experience the story in a whole new way. The strong themes make this a book geared toward high school teens, and its stunning graphic novel presentation makes it perfect to tempt reluctant readers as well.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terreece Clarke","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/terreece-clarke"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Kindred: A Graphic Novel Adaptation","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/28818221-kindred","isbn":"978-1419709470","datePublished":"2017-01-10","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Damian Duffy","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/1368385.Damian_Duffy"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/kindred-cover-opt.jpg?itok=2NUQ8Gco"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Adventures of Sophie Mouse Series","datePublished":"2016-03-01","description":"The stories and characters are a little formulaic, but this series is surprisingly good.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-adventures-of-sophie-mouse-series","reviewBody":"The stories and characters are a little formulaic, but this series is surprisingly good.

In The Upside of Unrequited, Molly has, by all accounts, an amazing life: two loving moms who adore each other and their three children; a fierce twin sister; a cute baby brother; lifelong friends who have her back; a cool multicultural neighborhood; and a fun summer job. But she's consumed with a sense that's something's lacking, because she's never actually been in love. Sure, Molly's had the epic 26 crushes, but they were all from afar and unrequited (she barely spoke to the objects of her crushes). Through Molly's journey of discovering what falling in love feels like, Albertalli has given voice to a character so often ignored and pushed into the jolly sidekick mode: the chubby girl who's sure she'll die a virgin because adolescent guys, even in progressive Montgomery County, Maryland, are more likely to say \"no fatties\" or \"you're pretty for a big girl\" than to see how awesome she really is.\nThat's not to say that Albertalli made Molly into some romance-novel model of a plus-size perfection. Molly's not rocking any big-and-beautiful or fat-acceptance labels; she's just not constantly trying to diet or obsessed with her weight. And the story (a companion to Albertalli's Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda) is about much more than Molly's weight or even her romantic prospects. It's also about how sisterhood and best friendship can change when one or the other person is in love; how loyalties and priorities shift when romance blooms and your inner circle grows; and how sisters sometimes have to grow apart, ever so slightly, to grow up. But, there is romance. For those worried that this is another intolerable romance, never fear. There's only one real and true viable option for Molly, and he's wonderful. He and Molly talk with an ease that should be a lesson for all young readers. Love is about attraction, yes, but that attraction can start with friendship and a sense of being seen and known -- not simply desired, although there's that, too. And when it all comes together, it's magical.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Upside of Unrequited","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/30653853-the-upside-of-unrequited","isbn":"978-0062348708","datePublished":"2017-04-11","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Becky Albertalli","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/7579036.Becky_Albertalli"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/the-upside-of-unrequited.jpeg?itok=G3DmRwcC"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Shadowcaster: Shattered Realms, Book 2","datePublished":"2017-04-14","description":"While the shift in main characters may disappoint, little else will in this epic-sized warring-kingdoms fantasy sequel with hints of magic and romance.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/shadowcaster-shattered-realms-book-2","reviewBody":"While the shift in main characters may disappoint, little else will in this epic-sized warring-kingdoms fantasy sequel with hints of magic and romance.

Pinkney's pencil-and-watercolor art makes &quot;The Three Billy Goats Gruff&quot; a triumph. He excels at drawing animals, making them realistically animal-like and expressive at the same time. The faces of his goats are sweetly appealing, while his troll is suitably scary, a gnarled green creature with fangs, claw-like nails, and a snapping lion's tail. He also pulls out lots of action words -- \"SPLASH!\" \"GULP!\" -- to enliven the telling and adds a foldout page to extend the fun when the biggest goat crashes the gate -- \"BAM!\"\nBut the real coup is that Pinkney manages to give the story a more thoughtful ending without taking the bite out of it. The goats do triumph, and the troll does get his comeuppance, but he doesn't die or disappear, and the art sagely suggests that the end of the book might actually be a new beginning for the troll and goats. This story, with lots of opportunities for repetition and prediction, preserves the fun of the beloved original while inviting discussions about greed, bullying, and chances to change.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Three Billy Goats Gruff","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0316341576","isbn":"978-0316341578","datePublished":"2017-05-09","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jerry Pinkney","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jerry_Pinkney"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/three-billy-goats-gruff-pinkney-500x500.jpg?itok=QZTJ6LqF"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Shadow Cipher: York, Book 1","datePublished":"2017-05-23","description":"Laura Ruby's middle-grade alt-New York series opens with an imaginative premise, engaging characters, a suspenseful plot, oddball brilliance, relatable issues, and quite a few laughs.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-shadow-cipher-york-book-1","reviewBody":"Laura Ruby's middle-grade alt-New York series opens with an imaginative premise, engaging characters, a suspenseful plot, oddball brilliance, relatable issues, and quite a few laughs.

The stories are engaging, the vocabulary is age appropriate but offers some challenges, and young readers might be surprised how much they enjoy reading about the importance of responsibility and integrity.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie Kingsley","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/carrie-kingsley"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Carver Chronicles Series","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/17165935-dog-days?ac=1&from_search=true","isbn":"978-0544339125","datePublished":"2014-10-14","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Karen English","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/141714.Karen_English"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/carver-chronicles-pic.jpg?itok=pC53L-wA"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Refugee","datePublished":"2017-06-13","description":"This ambitious, harrowing page-turner is chock-full of historical information, and it succeeds in providing a vivid window onto the lives of three fictional child &quot;Refugee&quot;s.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/refugee","reviewBody":"This ambitious, harrowing page-turner is chock-full of historical information, and it succeeds in providing a vivid window onto the lives of three fictional child &quot;Refugee&quot;s. Author Alan Gratz alternates the three stories set in different countries and time periods, keeping the chapters in &quot;Refugee&quot; short and ending each on a cliffhanger, which makes them easy to follow. Gratz writes fast-paced, suspenseful fiction while involving us with characters who seem like real, relatable kids. Though he never lets up on his characters, who face new danger at each page turn, all the kids travel with their families, so there's comfort in that. He also skillfully manages to loosely relate the different stories and characters at the end, which adds to the poignancy and satisfaction.\nThe only quibble might be his handling of the historical context for the Cuban story. Gratz doesn't mention until his Author's Note at the end that the U.S. trade embargo has been a significant contributing factor to the hardship endured by the Cuban people, important information since the U.S.-Cuba relationship remains a thorny political issue. But the novel as a whole is masterful, and readers will be spellbound by these three very moving stories, which can help them understand and develop empathy for families who are &quot;Refugee&quot;s.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Refugee","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0545880831","isbn":"978-1338191073","datePublished":"2017-07-25","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alan Gratz","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/68794.Alan_Gratz"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/511v17u0t7l-sx327-bo1204203200.jpg?itok=nGMWyFe0"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Saints and Misfits","datePublished":"2017-06-17","description":"This empowering multicultural coming-of-age story uses engaging and relatable teen characters to take on big issues of faith, identity, and sexual assault.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/saints-and-misfits","reviewBody":"This empowering multicultural coming-of-age story uses engaging and relatable teen characters to take on big issues of faith, identity, and sexual assault.

Readers are always in good hands with author-illustrator Adam Rex, who goes all-out in &quot;Nothing Rhymes with Orange&quot;. The fruits in the art are photo-realistic, making them easily recognizable for kids just learning the differences, and Rex draws expressive faces and arms and legs to animate them. There's lots of wordplay: A pear that gets bitten by a wolf becomes a \"pearwolf.\" And the book gets sillier and sillier with each page, even including a joke referencing Nietzsche, making sure adults feel included, too: \"I think cherries are 'the berries' and a lychee is just peachy. Thus Spoke Zarathustra in a book by Friedrich Nietzsche.\"\nAdding to the fun are the snide comments by Orange, who observes dejectedly from the sidelines. \"This book's sorta gone off the rails. I'm glad I'm not a part of it.\" But Rex also has a warm heart, and makes sure we feel for Orange as he grows more and more disheartened. Kids will recognize the feelings and cheer when another fruit notices and pulls him into the festivities.

The story's told in tight, detailed panels that celebrate the small pleasures of waking up and traveling to work each day. There's window-shopping and stops in small specialty shops, where Crocodile buys a pretty bouquet he delivers to someone at work. When he's splashed by a passing car, we see the culprits, a harried mom at the wheel and a kid sticking out his tongue. It's fun that Crocodile wears a tie and sits on the toilet, though he dreams of living in the wild. And though the subway car's crowded with humans, kids will spot the well-dressed giraffe and monkey who are also commuting. There's lots of visual detail to pore over and savor.\nSome parents will wonder: Why wordless? How do you even \"read\" a wordless book? And why not steep kids in rich text when they're smack in the midst of learning language? Though some might wish for just a bit of well-placed text here to match the fun of the art, wordless books can definitely be fodder for language development. Parents and kids can \"tell\" the story, and talk about all that's happening in the art. And this book has plenty of story, complete with plot and character development. Plus, surprise! Shhh!

For instance, when Jasper cuts up the underwear with his mom's scissors, Jasper thinks, \"She didn't like him using them, but this was an underwear emergency.\" And when he digs a hole to bury the underpants, the hole is \"100% underwear-proof.\" All of which helps highlight his shaky insistence, \"A grown rabbit couldn't be terrified of his underpants.\"\nPeter Brown's art is the perfect pairing. He renders the underwear in a garish green, the fluorescent color of nuclear waste, and for maximum effect, juxtaposes it against black backgrounds. When Jasper's afraid of the dark, Brown gives us a full spread that's completely black, followed by one that's all black except for two wide, frightened eyes.

The family, retro cars, and street scenes are lovingly rendered using a combination of pencil drawing, painting, and textures added from photos.

Co-author Philip C. Stead has done the near impossible, turning Twain's extensive notes for a kids' story into a fresh and modern classic. Twain's work (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,  The Prince and the Pauper) is dense, and Stead opens it up. The book is formatted much like a picture book, liberally illustrated, with some blocks of text isolated. Stead preserves the classic style, sometimes addressing the reader directly, as well as Twain's wry eye, filtering it through a modern lens. For instance, our forefathers \"first burgled this land from its Original Citizens.\" He conceives of the task as a conversation between himself and Twain, interspersing the story with their fictional discussion about the story, and somehow, against all reason, this works beautifully.\nThe illustrations by Erin E. Stead are lush and gorgeous. Her animals are charming, her portraits of faces arresting, and her palette is subdued and calming. The main character is a boy of color. There's lots of white space, and some of the story is communicated via the art; for instance, we see that the kind old woman has fairy wings. This book feels like a beautiful, extended picture book and would be treasured in any home library.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Purloining of Prince Oleomargarine","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0553523236","isbn":"978-0553523225","datePublished":"2017-09-26","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mark Twain","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mark_Twain"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/51tuxb5ag1l-sx365-bo1204203200.jpg?itok=S2KZvsky"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Capital Mysteries Series","datePublished":"2016-07-01","description":"In this excellent series for young mystery buffs, Ron Roy keeps the pacing fast and the clues cryptic so readers have to earn the solution.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/capital-mysteries-series","reviewBody":"In this excellent series for young mystery buffs, Ron Roy keeps the pacing fast and the clues cryptic so readers have to earn the solution.

The premise of &quot;The Wolf, the Duck, and the Mouse&quot; has some of the elements of a fairy tale, and author Mac Barnett tinges the language with a classic feel. When the animals scare the hunter off, the text reads, \"'Oh woe!' said the hunter. 'Oh death! These woods are full of evil and wraiths!' He fled the forest and never returned.\" And the end wraps up like a fable: \"And that's why the wolf howls at the moon.\" But the story's shot through with dry humor, as if Barnett's looking at the genre through a wry side-glance. When the wolf feels sick from the ruckus inside, the duck shouts up a remedy: \"Eat a hunk of good cheese. And a flagon of wine! And some beeswax candles.\" Which of course provides the ingredients of that night's feast -- at which the duck toasts, \"To the health of the wolf!\"\nJon Klassen's textured, mixed-media art has just as much fun with the players, animating them and bringing the detail of their odd world vividly to life. The subtle messages underlying the story -- home is what you make it, friends arrive in the oddest ways, you can use ingenuity to protect yourself -- are all the more powerful delivered in this spirited, imaginative package.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Wolf, the Duck, and the Mouse","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=076367754X","isbn":"978-0763677541","datePublished":"2017-10-10","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mac Barnett","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/2855221.Mac_Barnett"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/61799cugpl-sx384-bo1204203200.jpg?itok=_rmUA05U"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Gabby Garcia's Ultimate Playbook: Gabby Garcia, Book 1","datePublished":"2017-07-26","description":"It's rare for a sports-themed book to hold broad appeal, but Iva-Marie Palmer deserves a trophy for serving up an engaging, relatable story about a Latina athlete that even gym-phobic kids can enjoy.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/gabby-garcias-ultimate-playbook-gabby-garcia-book-1","reviewBody":"It's rare for a sports-themed book to hold broad appeal, but Iva-Marie Palmer deserves a trophy for serving up an engaging, relatable story about a Latina athlete that even gym-phobic kids can enjoy.

Both troubled siblings Lada and Radu get about equal time here, alternating chapters, and both stories are absorbing. The contrast between how Lada and Radu handle themselves in the face of political turmoil and violence holds both threads together in a curious way. Lada misses Radu's charm and reasoning skills, Radu misses Lada's bravery. They both form alliances to compensate in Now I Rise, but readers know they will both succumb to their weaknesses without each other.\nAuthor Kiersten White has many strengths as a writer. If you love character-driven stories, the reflections of Radu and Lada are very deep here. As readers, we know their flaws and their self-doubt intimately. If you enjoy action, the siege on Constantinople has the level of tactical detail and suspense you'll find in the Battle of Helm's Deep from Tolkien's The Two Towers. The only small criticism: Sometimes in this 15th-century world, it's harder to visualize places like Constantinople without extra help. More wide-shot place detail in the writing would be welcome.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

It's more action-packed than previous installments, with Lockwood &amp; Co. threatened not just by the usual slew of creepy ghosts (La Belle Dame was a really fun one), but also by the bigwigs in their whole lucrative ghost hunting industry. The henchmen sent to keep the small agency quiet have their hands full when Lockwood comes up with his many schemes to fight back. With this search for the truth and a way to bring powerful people to justice, there's even more to root for in The Empty Grave.\nAnd we're also rooting for the great characters here. Lucy and Lockwood's relationship has always been devoted but distant -- think Mulder and Scully from the X-Files -- and both inch closer toward something new. Everyone rallies around the bumbling but brilliant George when he's injured -- including someone very unexpected. Quill Kipps, the guy everyone used to love to hate, is now a valued member of the team. And even Lucy's sardonic Skull ghost in a jar seems to have a softer side. Each of these little personal moments with the characters, plus a lot of humor, draw a big heart around an already compelling end to a fantastic mystery series.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

These spoonerisms make &quot;Runny Babbit Returns: Another Billy Sook&quot; even more fun to read. The poems, all centered around \"Runny Babbit\" and his animal friends, are puzzles to solve, requiring kids to actively listen and flip letters to decode the words and uncover the sense. The opening poem orients kids and explains how it works. Since kids are much closer to the experience of learning language in the first place, it's not so long ago that real words sounded equally new and silly to them, so these scrambles will tickle young funny bones.\nBut even without the switcheroos, these punch-line poems would be classic. Silverstein was a noted editorial cartoonist, and the black-and-white line drawings of the animals are perfect companions to the jaunty rhymes. Though the book has 42 poems that span 96 pages, don't be scared off from picking this up as a bedtime book. It guarantees giggles.

The frankness of What's Going on Down There? may prompt some blushing, but boys will be relieved to see so many of their common worries addressed. Gravelle goes beyond anatomical basics to explain why sexual harassment is a concern for everyone, to discuss the importance of the HPV vaccine, and to debunk myths about penis size and masturbation. \nOverall, the breadth and detail make this an excellent choice. But it makes a major misstep: A collection of men's thoughts on what they wished they knew as boys includes a quote about being \"a lot more aggressive with girls,\" and another that says \"what [girls] say isn't always what they mean.\" Coming at the end of the book, these comments undermine earlier messages about consent and respecting the wishes of others.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Darienne Stewart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/darienne-stewart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"What's Going on Down There?

Bardugo's take is both modern and fresh and steeped in Greek myth. The modern-and-fresh part will come as a surprise after the 2017 World War II-set Wonder Woman movie. Wonder Woman: Warbringer includes a cast of diverse New York City teens and young adults: Alia is half-black and wears braids, her best friend Nim is Indian, Jason's friend Theo is Brazilian with dark-brown skin. They all have a fun chemistry. Bardugo writes some great dialogue for them during those rare moments they're not in immediate danger.  If you're the sort to start to roll your eyes at the unending battles in superhero movies, you'll appreciate the careful character development layered in here.\nIf you're the sort to shout, \"Get on with it,\" you'll be taken care of, as well. The action scenes really pop the way superhero action should; a plane ripped apart, a car thrown in the air, a hail of bullets here and there, and a nightmarish Greek monster thrown in for good measure.

And they succeed just as well for more modern readers who are less entranced by the idea that a prince will solve everything or the prettiest girl gets the best outcome. Girls need cunning and bravery -- not looks -- here. And the princes are either monsters or cads.  \nThe illustrations by Sara Kipin seem to sprout like vines around the margins as each tale unfolds.

While neither the protagonist nor the simple plot is as initially engaging as those in The Fault in Our Stars or Paper Towns, the story takes off once Aza rediscovers Davis. They're both half-orphaned and lost, but for different reasons. An avid astronomer, Davis looks up to the stars, whereas Aza concentrates on her self -- or selves, since she's focused on her body as a biodome for microorganisms (the body being roughly 10 percent human and 90 percent microbial). Green brings them together in a sweetly romantic way, but the romance is somewhat doomed, considering Aza's myriad neuroses (kissing, while initially pleasant, turns sour once the intrusive thoughts about the billions of bacteria they've shared begin).\nFor a book less than 300 pages long, &quot;Turtles All the Way Down&quot; requires a lot of unpacking and invites the reader to think, think, think about everything from mental illness to first love to the intricacies of Star Wars mythology. Like Aza's unique name (from A to Z and back again), there are endless possibilities for conversation points stemming from Green's themes. There are also extended therapy sessions, mini-lessons on the biological importance of the tuatara (a nearly extinct lizard-like creature that lives past 150 years and is actually more like a dinosaur than a lizard), and a great deal of existential angst. Green inserts gentle doses of humor, usually courtesy of Aza's vivacious best friend Daisy (who writes Star Wars fanfiction as a hobby), but this is ultimately a dark book about the trappings of mental illness. It also has one of the most memorable endings in young adult literature. Green's books aren't about happily ever afters but about the hope and love of moving forward, no matter how difficult that might seem.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Turtles All the Way Down","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/35504431-turtles-all-the-way-down","isbn":"9781984847393","datePublished":"2017-10-10","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"John Green","sameAs":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Green_(author)"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/turtles-all-the-way-down.jpg?itok=QSSwcEHo"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Santa Calls","datePublished":"2017-10-28","description":"This wildly imaginative picture book has exciting adventure, glorious world-building, clever language, and a sweet sibling story with conflict, redemption, and resolution.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/santa-calls","reviewBody":"This wildly imaginative picture book has exciting adventure, glorious world-building, clever language, and a sweet sibling story with conflict, redemption, and resolution. &quot;Santa Calls&quot; takes readers on a mysterious journey to see Santa and his magical world and fight a noble fight, although they won't learn why Santa summoned them till they get back home. \nThe text is rich, colorful, and long, making it great for read-aloud.

Zed's small, quiet, and elven, while Brock's brazen and always ready with a smart-mouthed quip. While he provides contemporary, slangy humor, their dynamic shifts in interesting ways. Brock also engages in some romcom-like sparring with Liza, and we wonder if sparks might ignite in future books.\nThough the pages drip with monster blood, authors Zack Loran Clark and Nick Eliopulos also deal smartly and sensitively with issues of sexism, racism, and class. Liza, tutored in etiquette, is fierce and brave. Zed, half elven, has to deflect prejudice. And since the kids hail from different classes -- servant, merchant, and noble -- issues of class are talked about directly. The book slyly leaves some questions unanswered. As it ends, monsters are still at large, as well as some shady humans we've come to mistrust. Who's good? Who's not?

Do you often say no to their requests? Of course. And do they sometimes ask for outlandish things? Affirmative. But the requests author Amy Krouse Rosenthal features in the book are all within parental reach and feel sweet and connected.

The boy's irresistibly tousle-haired, and readers have to turn the page to find out if his requests are granted. The boy, dripping wet at the bathroom mirror, asks to use hair gel, and then we see he's spiked it for the family photo with a professional photographer.

White reads more like a sweet story than dry reportage and drives home the message that shy, observant kids can grow up to create great art. In &quot;A Boy, a Mouse, and a Spider: The Story of E.B. White&quot;, author Barbara Herkert takes a subtle approach and never bombards readers with facts; those can be found in the three-page author's note at back. Her text also has quiet echoes of E.B. White's style. Where White used lists to evoke the sensory pleasures of a barn -- \"the nearness of rats, the sameness of sheep, the love of spiders, the smell of manure ...\" -- Herkert inserts similar lists throughout, such as \"the ripe scent of manure, the creak of harness leather, the perfect shape of eggs, the snort of tired horses ...\"\nLauren Castillo's textured illustrations echo the homespun warmth of the original art of Garth Williams (Charlotte's Web, Stuart Little). Though here, instead of seeing young Fern in the barn visiting her animal friends, she sets Elwyn on the three-legged stool, underscoring the point that White had many of the same experiences he later gave his characters. The text and art together feel hushed, celebrating life's quiet spaces. And since the book directly poses the question \"I wonder what I might be?\" kids can be inspired when Elwyn realizes: \"Writing filled him with joy.

Told in alternating points of view, &quot;Far from the Tree&quot; follows three teens with complicated relationships to their origin stories. Recovering from her pregnancy and putting up baby \"Peach\" for adoption, Grace feels a kinship to her own biological mother, even though she adores her adoptive parents. Maya knows she's privileged but she feels jealous that she's obviously different from her sister Lauren, who's roughly her age but her adoptive parents' biological child. Meanwhile, Joaquin wasn't as lucky as the sisters he'd never met. Half-Latino, he, unlike the girls, was never adopted and went from foster home to foster home. Finally with a couple who love him, Joaquin is so scared to lose them he's not sure he fully believes in unconditional love.\nThe way the trio of siblings bonds is believable, humorous, and also emotional to read. Their fast connection emboldens each of them to face their fears and overcome personal obstacles. Also in the mix is Rafe, a new friend of Grace's who cares about and supports her in a way none of her pre-Peach friends could. As they slowly, slowly build to a romance, it's clear Rafe (who's Latino, like Joaquin) is one of the best potential boyfriends in contemporary young adult literature. Author Robin Benway never idealizes any of the characters; they're each utterly authentic, and she explores the overwhelming positives to adoption but also the sadness and loss associated with it. A must-read for teens who enjoy realistic fiction, this award-winning novel is both heartbreaking and uplifting in the best ways.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Far from the Tree","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/33830437-far-from-the-tree","isbn":"978-0062330628","datePublished":"2017-10-03","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Robin Benway","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/753097.Robin_Benway"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/far-from-the-tree.jpg?itok=_b60ZI6g"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Whiz Mob and the Grenadine Kid","datePublished":"2017-11-18","description":"There are few things as enjoyable as a good caper, and this heist novel set in France contains all the elements of the genre.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-whiz-mob-and-the-grenadine-kid","reviewBody":"There are few things as enjoyable as a good caper, and this heist novel set in France contains all the elements of the genre.

Author Shane Burcaw is a naturally likable guide to the disease and the impact it has on his daily routines, and he's remarkably able to find the fun in life. On a page about his motorized wheelchair, he labels not only the joystick and leg braces, but also the \"tattoo\" on his neck. He claims, \"I can pop a wheelie with my brother's help.\" And proving himself a game physical comedian, he illustrates a story about accidentally flipping out of his wheelchair with a close-up of his face, wide-eyed after being upturned in the grass.\nBecause &quot;Not So Different: What You Really Want to Ask About Having a Disability&quot; is illustrated with photos, by Matt Carr, readers get a true sense of what Burcaw and others with SMA  look like. Kids with disabilities will be happy to see themselves represented in a no-nonsense, positive light, and other kids will get honest, candid information from a narrator who comes across as a fun friend.

The \"docu-poems\" in Andrea Davis Pinkney's &quot;Martin Rising: Requiem for a King&quot; set a mood while documenting events. Confining the time to the three months leading up to the assassination allows kids to zoom in on a slice of civil rights history. Kids can piece the history together from clues in the poems and learn more from the book's informative back matter. Illustrator Brian Pinkney used watercolor, gouache, and India ink to create art that feels as poetic as the text. The washy golden yellows and moody blues turn stormy when King is shot.\nIn another risky move, the text doesn't tie the ragged strands of the assassination in a neat bow. One poem, entitled \"Unsolved History,\" asks the thought-provoking questions: \"Who was Martin's true assassin?\" \"Did somebody put him up to it?\" \"Is the government the guilty party?\" Though the overall subject matter of King's assassination is sad and bleak, art at the end pictures King in the center of a golden Easter Sunday sun, closing on a note of hope. \"But in the swill of our tears, we find gladness, too ....

Martin has a distinctive voice, yet any reader can relate to his concerns: reconciling fantasy with reality, trying to fit in, worrying about how he's perceived, figuring out how to connect with others. Especially poignant are the glimpses of how hard he and his family work to help Martin unlock himself, from his mother's yoga breaths to his beloved father's devotion and their fierce support of his unique view of the world. Reyl skillfully weaves in themes and symbolism from Proust, infusing the book with complex layers of meaning.

There's much to enjoy for a variety of ages, including new parents.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Regan McMahon","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/regan-mcmahon"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Here We Are: Notes for Living on Planet Earth","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/35169327-here-we-are?from_search=true","isbn":"978-0399167898","datePublished":"2017-11-14","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Oliver Jeffers","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/173545.Oliver_Jeffers"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/here-we-are.jpg?itok=k56zDT4e"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Roses and Radicals: The Epic Story of How American Women Won the Right to Vote","datePublished":"2018-01-10","description":"With the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment being celebrated in 2020, this is a timely, accessible, and unflinching look at the fight to give women the vote.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/roses-and-radicals-the-epic-story-of-how-american-women-won-the-right-to-vote","reviewBody":"With the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment being celebrated in 2020, this is a timely, accessible, and unflinching look at the fight to give women the vote.

When other girls get giggly about their preteen crushes, Ivy has glimmers that she's different, but the strength of her new crush on June takes her by surprise. Author Ashley Herring Blake gives Ivy wise friends and adults to talk to, who support her and help her tease out and express her feelings. No one imposes anything on her either way, and Robin, the older lesbian who puts up the family in her inn, counsels Ivy that she doesn't need to know all the answers, be sure about anything, or label herself prematurely, providing Ivy with a comfortable space to question.

Author Margot Lee Shetterly worked with Winifred Conkling, author of numerous nonfiction picture books, to present simple explanations of complicated historical events and scientific concepts. For instance, to explain segregation, the book says, \"She lived in Virginia, a southern state, where laws segregated, or kept apart, black people and white people.\" It then lists concrete examples: \"They could not eat in the same restaurants. They could not drink from the same water fountains.\" With similar clear and simple language, one woman becomes an engineer designing \"supersonic airplanes -- planes flying faster than the speed of sound.\" And threading the women's stories together is the refrain that each one \"was good at math. Really good.\"\nThe colorful illustrations by Laura Freeman make the compelling, human story come to life. The women look real in a way that will help kids relate. The art is evocative and emotionally exciting, playing on the inherent drama of the civil rights marches and the excitement of sending humans into space.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Hidden Figures: The True Story of Four Black Women and the Space Race","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/35008834-hidden-figures?from_search=true","isbn":"978-0062742469","datePublished":"2018-01-16","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Margot Lee Shetterly","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Margot_Lee_Shetterly"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/screen-shot-2018-01-23-at-102506-am.png?itok=SLWZGmm5"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"March Forward Girl: From Young Warrior to Little Rock Nine","datePublished":"2018-02-03","description":"This is a powerful, heartrending, and sometimes shocking memoir of life in the segregated South of the 1940s and '50s, told through the eyes of an African American girl.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/march-forward-girl-from-young-warrior-to-little-rock-nine","reviewBody":"This is a powerful, heartrending, and sometimes shocking memoir of life in the segregated South of the 1940s and '50s, told through the eyes of an African American girl.

For instance, to tell us Ada was punished, Stone introduces Ada's cat, Madame Puff, who \"never, ever made her stand in a dark closet until she promised to behave,\" as Ada\u2019s mother did. And when her father fled the country, she writes, \"owing enormous sums of money, Lord Byron leaped into a gilded coach he hadn't paid for.\" An informational section at the end, entitled \"More to the Story,\" matches the story's breezy and conversational tone.\nMarjorie Priceman's art is equally engaging. She fills the pages with fanciful detail as well as swirling numbers and equations. Her colorful ink-and-gouache paintings are full of fun detail that humanizes Ada. Young Ada's pictured with flyaway, corkscrew curls. While working at her desk, she rests her feet on her sleeping cat. And while maids outfit her in a ball gown, she stands on books and holds one to read.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Who Says Women Can't Be Computer Programmers?: The Story of Ada Lovelace","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=1627792996","isbn":"978-1627792998","datePublished":"2018-02-20","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tanya Lee Stone","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/75499.Tanya_Lee_Stone"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/61raf50ntul-sx258-bo1204203200.jpg?itok=wSg71dt1"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Truth as Told by Mason Buttle","datePublished":"2018-01-30","description":"","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-truth-as-told-by-mason-buttle","reviewBody":"Leslie Connor has created another unforgettable, unlikely hero in Mason, a large, lonely seventh-grader whose grieving heart aches for just the simplest moments of connection with the people he loves. &quot;The Truth as Told by Mason Buttle&quot; unfolds in his remarkable voice: straightforward, frank, and full of sweet surprises.

Sometimes our problems appear to be &quot;More Than We Can Tell&quot; because we don't think anyone will understand, but readers, especially those who find themselves in difficult situations, will see that asking for help isn't a sign of weakness.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Amanda Nojadera","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/amanda-nojadera"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"More Than We Can Tell","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/34236194-more-than-we-can-tell","isbn":"978-1681190143","datePublished":"2018-03-06","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Brigid Kemmerer","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/4629194.Brigid_Kemmerer"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/more-than-we-can-tell.jpg?itok=OKs40WeC"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health","datePublished":"2017-02-26","description":"Human sexuality is timeless but not unchanging -- and this fresh update of Robie H.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/its-perfectly-normal-changing-bodies-growing-up-sex-and-sexual-health","reviewBody":"Human sexuality is timeless but not unchanging -- and this fresh update of Robie H. Harris' 1994 classic helps guide kids coming of age at a time when digital media can be both a blessing and a curse. It's Perfectly Normal aims to arm kids with knowledge to make informed, thoughtful decisions about their sexual behavior and relationships, and it does so with a frankness that some families will find refreshing while others may feel it's inappropriate.\nHarris and illustrator Michael Emberley take a straightforward and inclusive approach, portraying a diverse range of ethnicities and body types, discussing different religious and personal beliefs, and encouraging respect for individual preferences. They also dive into contemporary concerns about cyberbullying, respecting boundaries, sexting, and online pornography and misinformation. Parents should review it first to make sure it's right for their children and to prepare for follow-up conversations.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Darienne Stewart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/darienne-stewart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=H2IdBAAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-0763668716","datePublished":"2014-08-08","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Robie H.

This book packs so much in so little that word lovers will want to read &quot;The Word Collector&quot; again and again. Author-illustrator Peter H. Reynolds grounds young readers by first introducing the concept of collections, picturing kids collecting bugs and baseball cards. \"And Jerome? What did HE collect?\" As Reynolds tells us with a concise literary flair, Jerome collects \"Short and sweet words. Two-syllable treats. And multi-syllable words that sounded like little songs.\"\nThe book brims with treats. When Jerome finds words in a book, the art shows him with an open copy of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, writing down the word \"Emerald.\" One page notes \"words whose sounds were perfectly suited to their meaning,\" while picturing kids' drawings of \"torrential,\" \"bellow,\" and a smudged-out \"smudge.\" And the pages on which Jerome practices some of his \"most powerful\" words, such as \"I understand\" and \"I\u2019m sorry,\" are so touching they send a little shiver up the spine.

Most of the action in &quot;The Girl Who Ran: Bobbi Gibb, the First Woman to Run the Boston Marathon&quot; takes place before and during the 1966 Boston Marathon, when Bobbi Gibb -- stealthily! -- became the first woman to run. Who doesn't like a story in which a woman is plucky enough to disguise herself in guy's clothes, hide her hair in a hoodie, and dash out from the bushes to run with the boys? And when she's about to cross the finish line, there's a double foldout page to open, which feels as celebratory as popping a cork.\nToday's young readers will be surprised to realize that it wasn't so long ago that women were banned from marathons. Authors Frances Poletti and Kristina Yee choose details that will make kids gasp -- for example, that people told Bobbi she would \"injure herself,\" and that she had to wear men's running shoes \"since they didn't make them for girls.\" Susanna Chapman's appealing illustrations capture Bobbi on the run, trailed by a whoosh of wind, with wisps of hair flying from her hoodie. Text swirls on the page to illustrate both the chorus of naysayers who try to quash her -- \"Don't be silly.\" \"So unladylike.\" \"It's against the rules.\" -- and the cheers that celebrate her at the end -- \"Go, girl, go!\" \"You're my hero!\" \"We're all behind you!\" The book makes clear that Bobbi's success paved the way for women who came after her to participate freely.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Girl Who Ran: Bobbi Gibb, the First Woman to Run the Boston Marathon","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/35186710-the-girl-who-ran?from_search=true","isbn":"978-1943200474","datePublished":"2017-06-13","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Frances Poletti","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/14128723.Frances_Poletti"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9781943200474-p0-v1-s600x595.jpg?itok=kyo0ink8"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Calling My Name","datePublished":"2018-03-12","description":"Hauntingly honest and incredibly engaging, this novel has such rhythmic and lyrical prose that even the awful moments have significant beauty.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/calling-my-name","reviewBody":"Hauntingly honest and incredibly engaging, this novel has such rhythmic and lyrical prose that even the awful moments have significant beauty.

In this world, humans are treacherous and seldom to be trusted because of their \"endless greed and ambition.\" Humans don\u2019t \"understand the balance in life.

The sun's described as \"flushed as a ripe peach.\" Khara peers through thick fog that \"had crawled in from the sea, obscuring the world and softening the moon to a fuzzy orb, like the last days of a dandelion.\" Despite the blood and gore, or perhaps because of it, and because kids are asked to take the point of view of an animal, readers are prompted to think about the threat of extinction as it looms.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Endling #1: The Last","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0062335553","isbn":"978-0062335548","datePublished":"2018-05-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Katherine Applegate","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/K._A._Applegate"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/81y-ybjgwvl.jpg?itok=N3Z1p6MI"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Juli\u00e1n Is a Mermaid","datePublished":"2018-05-17","description":"In this delightful, mermaid-themed heartwarmer, gender is as fluid as the sea Juli\u00e1n dreams of swimming in.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/julian-is-a-mermaid","reviewBody":"In this delightful, mermaid-themed heartwarmer, gender is as fluid as the sea Juli\u00e1n dreams of swimming in. There's so much to praise in &quot;Juli\u00e1n Is a Mermaid&quot;, beginning with its original handling of the subject. This is no formulaic \"it's fine for boys to be mermaids\" story. Juli\u00e1n's imaginative transformation into a mermaid, and his actual transformation via costume, are conveyed via art alone. And by handling most of the story visually, author-illustrator Jessica Love avoids text that might clang or seem preachy. Love sets her story in a neighborhood that's urban -- Juli\u00e1n and Abuela take the subway, and girls cavort in a fire hydrant sprinkler -- but she slyly shows us that they also live near the ocean: That's a seagull, not a pigeon, strutting on the sidewalk.\nThe residents of the neighborhood are all brown-skinned, with characters who seem so real, we feel we've met them before. The opening art shows five older women in a pool, looking endearingly lumpy in their loudly patterned swimsuits. Abuela, with her lined face and seen-it-all, often inscrutable expression, is a character study in stern, no-nonsense love, and there's real dramatic tension when she discovers Juli\u00e1n dressed as mermaid.

It's difficult to write effective narratives that take place all in one day or night, but author Gayle Forman already accomplished that in the first part of Just One Day. In &quot;I Have Lost My Way&quot;, she expands on the idea of intense relationship-building, life-changing days with this unforgettable chronicle of how Freya, Harun, and Nathaniel, all of whom are bearing considerable burdens, crash into one another and go from total strangers to friends who share the deepest of secrets. Despite their different backgrounds, racial\/ethnic identities, and circumstances, the three teens each have serious father issues: Freya's dad moved back to Ethiopia and abandoned the family; Harun's is loving, but he's a devout Muslim who wouldn't understand his son's sexual orientation; and Nathaniel's brought him up more as his best friend than as a son.\nForman handles the diversity with thoughtfulness and a sense of well-researched authenticity (the author is a Jewish New Yorker and has an adopted Ethiopian daughter). The representation in &quot;I Have Lost My Way&quot; goes way beyond just mentioning a last name or an ethnicity\/faith. These three characters are all well-rounded, and their family experiences are thoroughly explored. Thank goodness for the humor, like the fun park softball sequence, to break up the more serious and downright heartbreaking moments. The attraction and developing romance between Freya and Nathaniel is fast without devolving into stereotypical \"instant love.\" Although this book is a standalone, readers will finish the final scene hoping for more from these characters who've burrowed their way into hearts and minds.\n \n ","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"I Have Lost My Way","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/36470842-i-have-lost-my-way","isbn":"978-0425290774","datePublished":"2018-04-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Gayle Forman","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gayle_Forman"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/i-have-lost-my-way.jpg?itok=vCBBnf_8"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Prince and the Dressmaker","datePublished":"2018-03-28","description":"Talented illustrator Jen Wang has written a lively, engaging, and mold-breaking take on the classic fairy tale with the poor girl who meets Prince Charming.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-prince-and-the-dressmaker","reviewBody":"Talented illustrator Jen Wang has written a lively, engaging, and mold-breaking take on the classic fairy tale with the poor girl who meets Prince Charming.

She doesn't bother with humility -- she knows the damage she can do with her sickles and that table manners and upper-crust etiquette are trifling considerations. And although there's a tiny love triangle with two viable suitors, the romance is way on the back burner while Jane (who's biracial but not fair enough to pass) and her perfectly put-together classmate Katherine (who is described as having a passing-for-white complexion, blue eyes, and golden hair) work together to defeat the nefarious plans of Summerland's vile father-and-son preacher and sheriff. Katherine enjoys the finer things but also resents how her beauty is also a burden and that she's underestimated (even by Jane, once in a while) because of her face.\nJane and Katherine lead the charge, while the men in the story are all supporting characters, whether they're good, evil, or roguish. Red Jack, Jane's former beau, is desperate to find his little sister (who, like Katherine, can \"pass\"); Gideon is the genius forced to keep Summerland's electricity flowing; and Summerland's reigning father and son believe in the despicable white supremacy that keeps the frontier town's black Attendants in place. In flashbacks, readers will also get to know Jane's white, plantation-running Momma, as well as the various black aunties, particularly Aggie, who raised Jane at Rose Hill. There's also a layered quality to the story: Readers can enjoy it for the surface layer of zombie slaying or dig in further to uncover the sociopolitical and historical commentary. Readers of color may especially connect to the themes of oppression and systemic racism.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Dread Nation","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/30223025-dread-nation","isbn":"978-0062570604","datePublished":"2018-04-03","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Justina Ireland","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/5833089.Justina_Ireland"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/dread-nation.jpg?itok=uOzhVukG"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Road Trip with Max and His Mom","datePublished":"2018-04-20","description":"Poignant, funny, and sweet, this story about a kid's life post-divorce is realistic without being heavy.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/road-trip-with-max-and-his-mom","reviewBody":"Poignant, funny, and sweet, this story about a kid's life post-divorce is realistic without being heavy. Like the first installment in this three-book series (a third is due in 2019), &quot;Road Trip with Max and His Mom&quot; does a good job illustrating the shifts that occur after a parents' split, while steadily maintaining a kid's point of view. Author Linda Urban deftly handles those awkward moments of post-divorce life, which are packed with emotional meaning. In one instance, Max invites his dad on the road trip, the details of which his parents have clearly arranged behind-the-scenes. Max's mom gently says that Dad is not invited and goes on to explain that she and Max's dad may not be very good at spending time with each other, but \"we're both very, very good at loving you.\"\nUrban takes on a subject that many families have trouble discussing, and the warmth, character, and inclusiveness that this book exudes is inspiring. Max is a kid who's scared and brave and mixed up, but he's ultimately able to move forward. And here's why: His parents make sure to pay attention to Max's needs while adjusting to their own circumstances.

Grimes' poetry shows rather than tells the story, and that makes &quot;Bronx Masquerade&quot;  a remarkable, heartwarming read.\nThe book's pacing and subject matter makes it great for reluctant readers, as well.

Nothing is as it seems, and that's what makes &quot;Between the Lines&quot; work -- because everyone can relate to wearing a mask to face the world. Everyone can relate to being afraid to be judged for revealing who they truly are, especially when the truth is embarrassing, scary, sad, or uncomfortable. The book clearly illustrates the need for a safe space for teens to explore and express themselves as they navigate the transition between adolescence and adulthood. It also reiterates the importance of supportive, stable adults in kids' lives.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terreece Clarke","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/terreece-clarke"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Between the Lines","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/33357465-between-the-lines?ac=1&from_search=true","isbn":"978-0399246883","datePublished":"2018-02-13","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nikki Grimes","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/25492.Nikki_Grimes"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/between-the-lines_0.jpg?itok=x4ukptBx"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Ada Lace Series","datePublished":"2018-04-02","description":"Books that are educational, engaging, and steeped in science are gems, and this series with a young girl at the center offers young readers a chance to see science from a rare perspective.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/ada-lace-series","reviewBody":"Books that are educational, engaging, and steeped in science are gems, and this series with a young girl at the center offers young readers a chance to see science from a rare perspective.

And because it\u2019s wordless, it calls on readers to interpret visual clues to the civilizations pictured. Though it's framed by a contemporary story about a girl mourning her dog, it's more a compelling meditation about time than it is about loss. Does the girl understand where she and her dog stand in the cosmos, and how they're connected to life that's passed before? When she presses the stone to her cheek, she appears to.\nAaron Becker's a stunning illustrator who threads the stories together in subtle ways. At the start, the girl and her father both wear necklaces with golden beads, as does one of the tribesmen in the first group of humans. When the meteorite first crashes to Earth, it embeds itself in the ocean floor, and, in a series of panels, works its way up and out as ocean becomes land, and dinosaurs give way to early mammals. Though some of the stone's passages are spurred by war and strife, and people clash with swords and arrows, there's a spiritual comfort to the slow passage of time.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"A Stone for Sascha","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0763665967","isbn":"978-0763665968","datePublished":"2018-05-08","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Aaron Becker","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aaron_Becker"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9780763665968-p0-v1-s600x595.jpg?itok=2_noESrE"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"All We Can Do Is Wait","datePublished":"2018-04-01","description":"Richard Lawson's debut is an edgy, compelling, unique, and moving tapestry of teens' lives and emotions.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/all-we-can-do-is-wait","reviewBody":"Richard Lawson's debut is an edgy, compelling, unique, and moving tapestry of teens' lives and emotions. &quot;All We Can Do Is Wait&quot; plunks a group of teens into the not-terribly-interesting setting of a hospital waiting room and allows the drab backdrop to fade away as the spotlight shines on each character, taking them in turns while also weaving back and forth in time.

Kids will relate to the story since it focuses on young \"Shorty\" as he leads his friends in a local brass band, and will have fun meeting the adult characters who bring out the special spice of one of our most distinct and colorful cities. \"Where y\u2019at?\" In the Quarter!\nCollier's art is staggeringly gorgeous. It's shot through with light and bright color, studded with textural collage elements, and celebrates the character of the city as well as the characters who people it. His faces -- such beautiful faces! -- keep us rapt and riveted. In this book, all the elements combine to create a lovely celebration of the rich musical and cultural heritage of New Orleans.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The 5 O'Clock Band","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=1683352793","isbn":"978-1419728365","datePublished":"2018-06-19","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Troy Andrews","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trombone_Shorty"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9781419728365-p0-v2-s600x595.jpg?itok=q072tFbv"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Amal Unbound","datePublished":"2018-05-08","description":"A suspenseful, sometimes heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting story that shines a bright light on indentured servitude and the role of education in empowering girls.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/amal-unbound","reviewBody":"A suspenseful, sometimes heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting story that shines a bright light on indentured servitude and the role of education in empowering girls.

In &quot;Where the Watermelons Grow&quot;, the fraught family situation feels tense in many ways. Mama neglects her responsibilities, leaving baby Mylie screaming in her crib, her diaper soiled. And because she worries someone's trying to harm her daughters, she nearly harms them herself, withholding food from Mylie, and soaking the kitchen with bleach. Author Cindy Baldwin makes clear that Della feels responsible for Mama's illness, since its onset was pregnancy. And she ventures into even more uncomfortable, unsettling territory when Della fears she herself may be genetically programed for schizophrenia later in life. Mama may get better, but she'll never be reliably normal. That's the unrosy reality Della has to live with.\nStill, Baldwin has crafted a sweet, tender book. She stocks the story with folks who rally around Della, never abandoning her in her distress. Baldwin also has a lovely writing style that exudes warmth. She describes Mama, \"her face relaxing and softening, the way the sky unwrinkles after a thunderstorm.\" And she's alert to the sensual detail of weather and place. \"The sky above me was moody, with thick stacked-up gray clouds that blew across he sun like sailboats.\" This loving treatment of a difficult childhood never feels heavy and is filled with light.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Where the Watermelons Grow","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0062665863","isbn":"978-0062665867","datePublished":"2018-07-03","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Cindy Baldwin","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/16027248.Cindy_Baldwin"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9780062665867-p0-v2-s600x595.jpg?itok=l-dNLmd_"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Brazen: Rebel Ladies Who Rocked the World","datePublished":"2018-06-01","description":"Capturing the essence of any person's life in a half-dozen pages is a formidable task, but this collection of mini-bios of rebellious and influential women hits the mark almost every time.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/brazen-rebel-ladies-who-rocked-the-world","reviewBody":"Capturing the essence of any person's life in a half-dozen pages is a formidable task, but this collection of mini-bios of rebellious and influential women hits the mark almost every time.

Zara's struggle to cope with the aftermath of the fictional terrorist attack is poignant, but the most heartrending moments are when readers get a glimpse of Nadja's traumatic past in Bosnia. As Zara continues to learn more about her mom, they slowly begin to help each other heal, which shows teens that beauty can come from tragedy and that love will always overcome hatred.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Amanda Nojadera","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/amanda-nojadera"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"We Are All That's Left","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/36106979-we-are-all-that-s-left","isbn":"978-0399175541","datePublished":"2018-05-15","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie Arcos","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/5752060.Carrie_Arcos"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/we-are-all-thats-left.jpg?itok=T-yoQCif"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Dreamers","datePublished":"2018-09-04","description":"While this exquisitely illustrated book follows the unsure path of an immigrant mom and child, it's also a heartfelt love letter to libraries and a joyous celebration of picture books.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/dreamers","reviewBody":"While this exquisitely illustrated book follows the unsure path of an immigrant mom and child, it's also a heartfelt love letter to libraries and a joyous celebration of picture books. In the beginning, when the two were \"unable to understand and afraid to speak, we made lots of mistakes,\" we see them puzzling over a map of their new city, and confronted by a policeman when they sit in a fountain. But when they discover the library and its bountiful children's section, the book takes an ecstatic turn. Author-illustrator Yuyi Morales conveys her deep love of picture books, showing the familiar covers of many of the books she came to love. Those images will be especially fun for readers, who will recognize their own old friends.\nThe art in &quot;Dreamers&quot; is stunning, rich with Mexican imagery. When the mom and child pack to leave, \"we bundled gifts in our backpack,\" including a Day of the Dead skeleton, a howling dog, a guitar, and a smoking volcano, underscoring Morales's point that immigrants come bearing the gift of their culture. And the book itself slyly illustrates the point. In her new country, Morales was introduced to, and came to love, picture books. Now she creates picture books using the wealth of images she grew up with, generously offering us a lovely marriage of cultures. The list at the end of \"Books That Inspired Me\" is the perfect cap to this greathearted book.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Dreamers","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0823440559","isbn":"978-0823440559","datePublished":"2018-09-04","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yuyi Morales","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/389601.Yuyi_Morales"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/dreamers-600x900_0.jpg?itok=02uHDFQg"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"A Parade of Elephants","datePublished":"2018-09-21","description":"Who doesn't love a parade of pastel-colored elephants that look tastily candy-colored and serve up a series of palatable lessons about basic preschool concepts?","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/a-parade-of-elephants","reviewBody":"Who doesn't love a parade of pastel-colored elephants that look tastily candy-colored and serve up a series of palatable lessons about basic preschool concepts?

In &quot;The Parker Inheritance&quot;, the two main kids are smart, savvy, and plucky as they puzzle out a mystery and bring to light a racist incident that reverberated through their town more than half a century ago. Author Varian Johnson does not shy away from difficult issues, and his take on race is nuanced. In the earlier history, some light-skinned blacks opt to pass as white, the African American characters are aware of relative skin shade, and though some fight for school integration, others have strong affection for their all-black schools and communities. \nThough the multimillion-dollar prize for solving the puzzle (promised in the found letter) is a somewhat unrealistic fairy tale element, it adds fun, ups the stakes, and spurs suspense. The chapters set in the 1950s provide a compelling history lesson for today's kids. African American readers will recognize themselves and their families in the warm, playful banter and dialogue, and in the exchanges the characters have with the wider world.

It draws much of its strength from the frank observations of its poor white narrator, whose own life is hardscrabble and not sentimentalized. Though Charlie's only 12, he shoulders crushing responsibilities and weathers a stream of casual cruelty from his mom. But author Christopher Paul Curtis makes sure that we like and root for Charlie from the first pages, when he's shown sweetly tending a vulnerable litter of puppies.\nThe appeal of this finely drawn character is that he's not a perfect human. Curtis makes clear that Charlie's a product of, and participates in, the prejudices of his time, exhibiting the expected attitudes about \"darkies,\" and taunting \"Petey the dimwit.\" But Charlie feels ashamed of bad behavior, and makes very conscious choices to act, and even think, differently. In this, he serves as an excellent model for readers to emulate. Though the novel's sobering, it's also graced with moments of lightness; for instance, when Charlie reflects on the Cap'n \"smelling ripish,\" though he himself's much cleaner since \"don't too many summer months get away from me without one bath in 'em.\" This beautiful, transcendent novel moves quickly toward its hopeful end.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Journey of Little Charlie","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=1338164007","isbn":"9781432861445","datePublished":"2018-01-30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Christopher Paul Curtis","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Christopher_Paul_Curtis"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9780545156660-p0-v3-s600x595.jpg?itok=dAwNQUCC"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"A House That Once Was","datePublished":"2018-06-27","description":"This haunting poem about an abandoned house \"haunted\" by the household objects its former owners left behind is pure pleasure to read and reflect on.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/a-house-that-once-was","reviewBody":"This haunting poem about an abandoned house \"haunted\" by the household objects its former owners left behind is pure pleasure to read and reflect on. Though &quot;A House That Once Was&quot; is contemplative, it never sinks into sadness. The kids are adventurers. When they imagine the previous owners, they dream up exciting lives. And the story has a happy, hopeful ending. The house, though changed, still hums with life. \"And maybe it likes it out there in the forest \/ with the trees coming in where the roof used to go.\" As the kids leave to go home, a bluebird in that tree delivers worms to the hungry babies in her nest.\nThough there's some light rhyme, author Julie Fogliano's verse is never singsong, and the poem draws much of its forward-moving rhythm from a soothing, mesmerizing repetition. Lane Smith cleverly adds a fun switcheroo to the art: The illustration of the kids as they explore are gauzily dappled and dreamy, while the scenes they imagine are more vividly defined. Take a breath. Slow down. This is a book for kids and adults to savor together at the end of a busy day.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"A House That Once Was","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=1626723141","isbn":"978-1626723146","datePublished":"2018-05-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Julie Fogliano","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/4999425.Julie_Fogliano"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9781626723146-p0-v1-s600x595.jpg?itok=B6R5XJen"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Day War Came","datePublished":"2018-09-04","description":"This moving, haunting story of a young refugee draws its power from its simplicity, as the girl herself tells her own story, observing what's happening around her in ways kids can absorb.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-day-war-came","reviewBody":"This moving, haunting story of a young refugee draws its power from its simplicity, as the girl herself tells her own story, observing what's happening around her in ways kids can absorb. &quot;The Day War Came&quot; is frank and heartbreaking, but gentle. Author Nicola Davies makes clear this kid is like any other. As her day begins, \"My mother made my breakfast, kissed my nose, and walked me to school,\" where she learned about volcanoes, sang a song about tadpoles, and drew a picture of a bird. Then, \"war came,\" and her home and town are reduced to \"rubble,\" and, though it's downplayed, she loses her family. \"War took everyone. I was ragged, bloody, all alone.\" But when she peers in a school window near her refugee camp, she sees kids \"learning all about volcanoes, and singing, and drawing birds.\" And a kindhearted act of welcome and inclusion from a boy in the class infuses the story with hope.\nRebecca Cobb's art is as affecting as the text. At the start, the girl is smiling, though ominous helicopters loom in the background. The scenes of war and refugee camp contrast starkly, gray and drained of color, and her journey includes images familiar from the news: people crammed into overcrowded trucks and boats. But when she wanders from the camp into the nearby town, we again see color -- bright window boxes and shops with produce -- as well as a foreshadowing glimpse of the boy who will help.

Kids will love revisiting the familiar classic tales, then seeing how Chicken upends each one by inserting an elephant at a critical juncture. And of course, in each, her elephant of surprise is the element of surprise.\nDavid Ezra Stein's art is detailed and colorful, underscoring the warm family relationship. The happy, book-lined home is complete with comfy reading chair and bright, bloomy upholstery roses. The pages on which Papa reads snippets of fairy tales are muted and affect a classic look. By contrast, the elephant who interrupts those stories is bright blue, and dressed in hilarious costumes. (Gotta love the coconut shells that riff on the the Little Mermaid's seashells.) Readers will be charmed and swept along by Chicken's spirited story doctoring, just as Papa is.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Interrupting Chicken and the Elephant of Surprise","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0763688428","isbn":"978-0763688424","datePublished":"2018-09-11","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"David Ezra Stein","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/400898.David_Ezra_Stein"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9780763688424-p0-v1-s600x595.jpg?itok=l35Tqdkj"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Grenade","datePublished":"2018-10-08","description":"This expertly crafted, well-researched novel mines a historical battle for its page-turning drama while shining a light on the human cost of war and examining how war erodes our humanity.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/grenade","reviewBody":"This expertly crafted, well-researched novel mines a historical battle for its page-turning drama while shining a light on the human cost of war and examining how war erodes our humanity. In &quot;Grenade&quot;, author Alan Gratz spotlights soldiers and civilians from all sides of the battle: Americans, Japanese, and the Okinawans enlisted to fight for the Japanese but caught in the middle. For half the novel, Gratz alternates chapters, switching between two very young soldiers, one Okinawan and one American. Both are sensitive, tenderhearted boys who struggle with the killing that they see around them and that they are called to do.\nIn this book, there are no good guys and bad guys. Rather than glorifying war, it demonstrates concretely how war turns humans into soldiers who do monstrous things. \"They became monsters when they were afraid. It didn't excuse it, but it explained it.\" He also weaves in respectful details about the traditional spiritual beliefs and practices of the Okinawan people, taking the story beyond the battlefield and adding to the power of this sensitive, emotionally resonant book.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Grenade","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=1338245694","isbn":"978-1338311006","datePublished":"2018-10-09","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alan Gratz","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/68794.Alan_Gratz"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9781338245691-p0-v2-s600x595.jpg?itok=zvZhPqQa"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Guardians of the Taiga: Wild Rescuers, Book 1","datePublished":"2018-07-02","description":"Main character Stacy and her wolf family are fun, appealing, and determined as they go from one hair-raising adventure to another in this action-packed leap from Minecraft to the book world.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/guardians-of-the-taiga-wild-rescuers-book-1","reviewBody":"Main character Stacy and her wolf family are fun, appealing, and determined as they go from one hair-raising adventure to another in this action-packed leap from Minecraft to the book world.

Lada as prince is brutal, ruthless, and clever, earning her nickname as the Impaler in a scene no reader wants to truly visualize. She's the tragic character you can see headed to her immediate end without the help of her brother, Radu. Though Radu and Lada are far apart for most of the book, they are always connected. Author Kiersten White, known for charming, lighter fare before And I Darken (Chaos of Stars, Illusions of Fate), goes deep in these characters, exploring the differences between Radu and Lada and the choices they make, often in response to the actions of the other. Radu's connection to his chosen family and his Islamic faith, his acceptance of himself as a gay man, and his reluctance to be a leader make him the perfect counter to Lada. Lada knows she needs her brother; he knows he can't escape her in the end.\nAll that family drama does not take away from the pace of Bright We Burn -- at least not until the very end where the wrap-up is a little long. The action is just as absorbing. Lada's forces are outnumbered but constantly outmaneuvering the Ottomans. Readers will feel conflicted about just who to root for. Radu is the \"good\" choice, but Lada is cunning and relentless. It's both shocking and fascinating to see what strategies she employs in her brutal campaign. The whole series fascinates, and it's hard to see it end.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

For example, here's how the author explains Hitler's takeover of Austria: \"In March 1938, he annexes Austria with nothing more than blustery speeches and the tactics of a schoolyard bully. The Austrian government was so terrified of war with a lunatic they gladly gave Hitler their lunch money.\" &quot;The Faithful Spy: Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the Plot to Kill Hitler&quot; is a great book for anyone interested in -- or studying -- World War II. And kids and teens can relate to the deep questions Bonhoeffer struggles with: Does God hear me when I pray? Are believers called to action? Do people of faith have a responsibility to stand up against evil and fight injustice?\nAuthor-illustrator John Hendrix does an incredible job of making history exciting, maintaining the story's momentum, and balancing military, political, family, and romantic action with thought-provoking ideas about God and faith. Particularly clever are the times his illustrations veer into the metaphorical, such as picturing Hitler as a snarling wolf (his preferred nickname was the Wolf), soldiers as rats, or Bonhoeffer as a zookeeper when the text describes his doubts about his theological pursuits: \"Dietrich felt like he studied God as if he were an animal in a zoo, making careful observations and measurements but always at a safe and comfortable distance.\" Hendrix calls our hero by his first name, which helps make him relatable as an ordinary person caught up in extraordinary circumstances. And Hendrix quotes from Bonhoeffer's own writing, as well, marking those citations with an asterisk to make clear they are Bonhoeffer's exact words. Also helpful is his use of different colors for the \"good guys\" (Bonhoeffer, the plotters, ordinary Germans) in a bold turquoise and the \"bad guys\" (Hitler and the Nazis) in blood red, which helps readers track developments and issues in the story.

Ellie's well-developed, complicated character is a good starting point to get families talking about what can be difficult for many. Particularly important to teens are messages about listening when your inner voice isn't comfortable with what's going on, how hard it is to avoid mistakes even as you know you're making them, what makes you a worthwhile person, and how you can know and believe in your own value as a person.\nAs beautiful as Carter's use of language often is, &quot;I Stop Somewhere&quot; is almost as much a book about what's not said as it is about what's directly narrated. Vague descriptions of the violence leave more to the imagination, enhancing the horror and dread. Descriptions of teen sexual activity are also vague, yet really home in on the emotions and thoughts as Ellie experiences them. The story is well structured, although the twist comes a bit soon, and the poignant ending satisfies. Best for teens ready to tackle a tough topic through a complicated, deep, and thought-provoking character.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Beach","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/andrea-beach"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"I Stop Somewhere","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/29751533-i-stop-somewhere?from_search=true","isbn":"978-1250124647","datePublished":"2018-02-27","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"TE Carter","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/15141492.T_E_Carter"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/istop.jpg?itok=wCI3zJCu"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Little Do We Know","datePublished":"2018-07-30","description":"This is a compelling, emotional story about friendship, faith, loyalty, and love.

Some of the pieces in &quot;We Rise, We Resist, We Raise Our Voices&quot; focus on very specific issues. Eleanora E. Tate talks about having dark brown skin, and how to rise above people who belittle you. Hena Khan discusses what to do if you're Muslim and people call you a terrorist. One story's narrated by a kid whose father is seized and deported by ICE. Some writers tie events today to historical ones, like slavery or Jim Crow laws, making the point that troubling times have long existed, and others have found ways to resist and usher in positive change.\nSome of the most effective pieces address kids directly, as if writer and reader are in cozy conversation. Sharon G. Flake writes a letter to kids and signs it, \"Your fan and cheerleader.\" Tonya Bolden urges kids to make small, manageable changes, like \"compliment someone on an outfit or hairdo, congratulate a friend on a victory,\" acts that are easily within a kid's grasp. The message to readers is that they're not alone; the book connects them to larger communities, to elders with experience and good counsel. And it offers hope. As poet Marilyn Nelson tells kids, \"Today's acts of good will change tomorrow ... good is in control, and good will win.\"","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"We Rise, We Resist, We Raise Our Voices","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0525580441","isbn":"9780525580454","datePublished":"2018-09-04","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Wade Hudson","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/93600.Wade_Hudson?from_search=true"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9780525580423-p0-v4-s600x595.jpg?itok=bPGDvqj4"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"A Thousand Beginnings and Endings","datePublished":"2018-08-20","description":"There's a lot to love in this collection of Asian myths and legends, retold, re-imagined, and re-examined by authors delving into their cultural roots.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/a-thousand-beginnings-and-endings","reviewBody":"There's a lot to love in this collection of Asian myths and legends, retold, re-imagined, and re-examined by authors delving into their cultural roots.

Readers can think about what it might be like to move from a rural community with outhouses to stacked urban apartments with indoor plumbing. And Cline-Ransome makes it easy to enter the poem excerpts by tying them so closely to the boy's own experience. There's lots of information about the Bronzeville neighborhood of Chicago in 1946, and much of the story takes place in the historically significant George Cleveland Hall branch of the Chicago library, which hosted an important lecture series featuring black writers of the era.\nBut the book is never overwhelmed by the historical content and works beautifully on its own as a warm, touching story. Hearts will go out to this appealing young narrator as he tells his story, and eyes may tear up as he forges new human connections and begins to heal.

Hosseini is a gorgeous writer, and he's chiseled and polished &quot;Sea Prayer&quot; like a gem, offering just the right sensory detail to evoke the pleasures of the old life. When he was a boy, he and his brothers spread their mattresses on the roof of their farmhouse, and woke \"to the stirrings of olive trees in the breeze, to the bleating of your grandmother\u2019s goat.\" In contrast, his young son knows \"how a bomb crater can be made into a swimming hole.\" Now they wait in a crowd of other refugees, \"the women worrying in tongues we don\u2019t speak.\" And he reassures his son that \"Nothing bad will happen,\" though the words are just \"a father's tricks.\" The letter format, speaking directly to the son, gives the text a poignant immediacy.\nThough the subject matter is adult, and text is written for \"all ages,\" this book is accessible to older kids, and has the pleasures of a picture book.

De la Pe\u00f1a seeds &quot;Carmela Full of Wishes&quot; with telling details. Her mom works as a housekeeper in a hotel, and her dad used to stand outside the home improvement store, hoping to be hired as a day laborer. Some of Carmela's wishes are simple (going to the Laundromat with her big brother) and some are not so simple (fixing her dad's immigration status so he can return to the family). And yet, Carmela's a kid, recognizable and relatable. She squabbles with her older brother, feistily stands up for herself, wishes for a candy machine, and jingles her bracelets, both to please herself and to needle her brother. And, as any kid might, she cries when she takes a tumble and crushes her dandelion.\nIllustrator Christian Robinson's acrylic and collage illustrations work hand in hand with the text. The brown-skinned siblings and community members are appealingly expressive. Carmela's wishes are enshrined as papel picado, traditional Mexican decorations made of tissue paper with cutout shapes. Her most poignant wish, that her dad returns and embraces her, feels perfectly framed. And the human labor required for farming is underscored in the endpapers, which show scores of workers toiling in the fields.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Carmela Full of Wishes","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0399549056","isbn":"978-0399549045","datePublished":"2018-10-09","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt de la Pe\u00f1a","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=Matt+de+la+pena"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9780399549045-p0-v1-s600x595.jpg?itok=pCWR9KtY"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Sweep: The Story of a Girl and Her Monster","datePublished":"2018-09-24","description":"The Victorian Age may seem a long time ago, but as this clever, moving, and insightful novel shows, the problems people faced then still impact modern-day readers.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/sweep-the-story-of-a-girl-and-her-monster","reviewBody":"The Victorian Age may seem a long time ago, but as this clever, moving, and insightful novel shows, the problems people faced then still impact modern-day readers.

David writes that \"we hope that seeing things through our eyes will give you ideas of your own. Because none of us can do this alone and we need you, basically.\"\nDavid is self-deprecating and admits to sometimes being \"a jerk\" in middle school but also shows how finally connecting with caring teachers helped him grow up, become engaged and self-disciplined, and do well in high school. He explains that his eventual activism was grounded in all he'd learned about American history, government, politics, journalism, media, and even the gun control issue in his classes and on the debate team. Lauren shares the depths of her grief -- she lost two close friends in the shooting -- and how her commitment to working for change grew. David and Lauren's loving, supportive relationship and their warm, respectful relationship with their parents (their mom, an elementary school teacher and their dad, an FBI agent) is also an inspiring model.

It may spur readers to learn more about the crisis and find ways of supporting refugee children.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Berry","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/michael-berry"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Unwanted: Stories of the Syrian Refugees","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/36912588-the-unwanted","isbn":"978-1328810151","datePublished":"2018-09-18","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Don Brown","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/4198059.Don_Brown"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/unwanted.jpg?itok=ir7T3vGK"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Girls Resist!: A Guide to Activism, Leadership, and Starting a Revolution","datePublished":"2018-09-13","description":"This inspiring and empowering how-to guide girls who want to become involved in a cause (or are already involved) the tools they'll need to succeed.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/girls-resist-a-guide-to-activism-leadership-and-starting-a-revolution","reviewBody":"This inspiring and empowering how-to guide girls who want to become involved in a cause (or are already involved) the tools they'll need to succeed.

As Amber navigates divorce and friendships, her parents and teachers encourage her to talk about her feelings, and to be accountable for her actions. There's a huge amount of respect for Amber as a person; the adults in her world have hard conversations with her and are fully developed characters alongside Amber.\nThe running theme of the series is that life is constantly changing, so we should make the most of each day and each moment.

Only one, Sarai, Muse of Nightmares, is easy to root for. She gave up her scary profession when she met Lazlo. Minya and Nova take work to root for. Author Laini Taylor puts in this work, showing their vulnerabilities, suffering, and fears. Then their nearly all-consuming drive for revenge makes sense, and adds so much unsettling tension to the story. Minya and Nova may annihilate everyone in their path to get the vengeance they seek.

The colorful, creative photography and artwork by Sinem Erkas add delightful (and sometimes funny) touches, like using oranges and balloons to demonstrate breast size and sanitary pads for clouds and surfboards.

Readers don't need to know the story of Beowulf and Grendel to enjoy author April Genevieve Tucholke's Norse tale. But those who are familiar with the Old English classic will be utterly awed at how wonderful the writing, world-building, and narrative arc are in Boneless Mercies. Frey is a mesmerizing protagonist. She yearns for glory, for her name to live on in sagas and songs. She's bound to the compassionate and loyal Trigve, who is the kind of love interest young adult books need more of: young men who aren't afraid of strong and independent women. And more than anything, she basks in the friendship and camaraderie of her fellow Mercies, who are young women with their own stories. She's also fairly bloodthirsty. She wants a good death in battle.\nSomehow, Tucholke brings Frey's layers together in a likable whole. In fact, every character is utterly human and believably real, with backstories (most of them tragic) that explain their personalities and outlooks. The evocative prose is almost cinematic in nature: You sense the snowy landscapes, the muddy marsh, the fur pelts, the warmth of the hearth. The action sequences are nail-biters -- the Mercies bleed and bruise and scream in pain -- making the moments of feasting, drinking, and storytelling that much sweeter. Tucholke is a versatile writer, and this is the rare standalone that makes you long for a sequel. It's an ideal pick for fans of epic fantasies like Six of Crows, Seafire, and Frostblood.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Boneless Mercies","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/36949995-the-boneless-mercies","isbn":"978-0374307066","datePublished":"2018-10-02","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"April Genevieve Tucholke","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/April_Genevieve_Tucholke"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/the-boneless-mercies.jpg?itok=EwH0CFHq"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"More Than a Princess","datePublished":"2018-11-06","description":"Engaging, mysterious, and packed with adventure, this is no ordinary fairy tale.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/more-than-a-princess","reviewBody":"Engaging, mysterious, and packed with adventure, this is no ordinary fairy tale.

If books for kids about Native Americans have been predominantly historical, set pre-1900, &quot;We Are Grateful: Otsaliheliga&quot; provides a welcome current representation. It's nation specific, written by an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation, so Cherokee readers will recognize themselves and their families, and other readers can meet relatable kids who are pictured riding bikes, playing in a tree house, launching toy sailboats, and making a snowman, as well as families that gather for picnics, holiday meals, and celebrations.The book is structured around the four seasons, starting with fall, which we learn is the Cherokee New Year, as well as the time of the Great New Moon Ceremony.\nThe mesh of educational information with everyday detail is an easy weave, and the book includes Cherokee words, and a friendly pronunciation guide, as well as a Cherokee syllabary, and a page of \"Definitions\" that explain some concepts, such as the Trial of Tears, more fully. The art, by Fren\u00e9 Lessac, is brightly colored and appealing, and the book's message -- that it's important to give thanks, \"to celebrate our blessings and reflect on struggles\" -- is universal.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"We Are Grateful: Otsaliheliga","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=1632896338","isbn":"978-1580897723","datePublished":"2018-09-04","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Traci Sorell","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/17385615.Traci_Sorell"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/we-are-grateful-600x900.jpg?itok=U3GW9EZh"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Hello Lighthouse","datePublished":"2019-01-01","description":"This unique, intimate view of what lighthouses and lighthouse keepers do envelops readers in a distinctive world beautifully illustrated by author-illustrator Sophie Blackall.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/hello-lighthouse","reviewBody":"This unique, intimate view of what lighthouses and lighthouse keepers do envelops readers in a distinctive world beautifully illustrated by author-illustrator Sophie Blackall.

Acclaimed Canadian children's author Kenneth Oppel has done a similar melding of fantasy and family loss elements before in The Nest, but this one doesn't have the same creepy edge. This ink blob is a far more lovable creature than The Nest's strange angel-wasps. And one that brings a Mary Poppins sense of magic into the family's lives.\nSarah, the sister with Down syndrome, benefits the most from &quot;Inkling&quot;'s sense of whimsy. Ethan and his father benefit from his skill and his drive to find a family secret that can heal them. When &quot;Inkling&quot; goes missing, the loss feels more profound; this family doesn't need another setback. But like Mary Poppins, &quot;Inkling&quot;'s goal is to bring them together before he disappears, and to make them self-reliant and whole again. &quot;Inkling&quot; is a poignant and succinct read with some clever touches.

Author Sharon Draper captures these feelings with sensitivity and humor. She's also unafraid to tackle police brutality in the age of social media -- what that means for victims, and what it means for kids just trying to figure out who they are and how they fit in the world.\nKids will enjoy &quot;Blended&quot; for its realistic portrayal that makes them think but doesn't talk down to them.

Author Maureen Johnson has really hit her stride. The Shades of London series, also set in a boarding school, was really fun but didn't have this kind of polish. Johnson's most notable accomplishment is juggling crimes in two time periods and making them both seem incredibly urgent and exciting to solve. And, unlike a lot of mysteries that drag into trilogies, readers will be satisfied by the amount of crime-solving that's happened by the end of The Vanishing Stair.\nTeen characters remain fantastic. Readers will fantasize about sneaking off to Vermont to room with Stevie and her eccentric friends. Mr. Ellingham doesn't come off as well. Johnson still seems to have her \"Stevie\" hat on when writing him. He appears more concerned with solving the mystery than mourning his lost family. It's a minor quibble in an otherwise absorbing and satisfying mystery.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

In &quot;Genesis Begins Again&quot;, she does a great job capturing the way young teens think and act like adults one moment and like children the next. For example, when Genesis realizes neither of her parents is effective in breaking the cycle of hope and eviction, she takes matters into her own hands: She heads out to her father's job site to try and work something out with the boss-landlord. Yet once she gets on the bus, she becomes afraid at taking such a long ride by herself and relies on the driver for direction and reassurance. The other middle-schoolers also seem authentic in what excites them and what makes them upset. \nWilliams also does a good job of showing how parents look through their kids' eyes.

His books are truly on par with those from John Green, Gayle Forman, and Melina Marchetta. As Rainbow Rowell eloquently states in her blurb of the book, \"Anyone can break your heart -- Jeff Zentner can also make you laugh out loud.\" This is a book full of humor that endears the two main characters to the readers so much that when the tears come, at least there have been many laughs. And the tears aren't as heartbreaking as they've been in the previous two books, although there are still difficult themes explored, from absentee fathers and depressive mothers to the loneliness of feeling left behind. Those aspects are important, but it's the central friendship that makes the book such a memorable read.\nJosie and Delia are so close that despite not looking anything alike and coming from vastly different backgrounds, they are commonly mistaken for sisters. They share not only a healthy sense of humor but also their love of their show, complete with alter egos (in the vein of sillier, less cleavage-sporting Elviras, for Generation X parents and older). The developing and so-so-sweet romance between Josie and aspiring MMA champion Lawson (who is half-white, half-Mexican and brings in the book's only ethnic diversity) is refreshingly earnest in a time when many YA romances are based in conflict, stress, and sarcasm. But the romance, as lovely as it is, takes a backseat to the real love story, the sisterhood between Josie and Delia, who each have secrets and sadness (Delia's journey to find her missing father will particularly break readers' hearts) yet are each other's biggest cheerleaders.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Rayne & Delilah's Midnite Matinee","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/40645629-rayne-delilah-s-midnite-matinee","isbn":"9781524720230","datePublished":"2019-02-26","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jeff Zentner","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/8394519.Jeff_Zentner"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/rayne-delilahs-midnite-matinee.jpg?itok=joneUAyC"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Unsung Hero of Birdsong, USA","datePublished":"2019-02-25","description":"This well-told, relatable story focuses on a well-off white boy beginning to see and understand racism in the Jim Crow South after World War II.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-unsung-hero-of-birdsong-usa","reviewBody":"This well-told, relatable story focuses on a well-off white boy beginning to see and understand racism in the Jim Crow South after World War II.

Stoddard's superb ear for dialogue telegraphs family tensions so well that there's no need for description. What Rain hears her parents saying speaks volumes about their lives. The way the kids in Rain's new neighborhood talk -- or don't talk-- captures the vibrancy and quick pace of city living. &quot;Right as Rain&quot; expertly shows what it's like to survive the loss of a sibling, the shutting down, the grief and anguish, and the glimmer of hope that eventually surfaces. \nKids will appreciate the sensorial quality of the details: from the smell of rot emanating from Rain's homeless acquaintance and the stab of empathy Rain feels for that man, down to the gooey, warm, love-filled chocolate chip cookies from Ms. Dacie's kitchen. Kids who have heard their parents argue will relate to the way Rain feels pulled between them. Rain's new-kid experience at a school where she doesn't fit in is spot on, as is the warm feeling of belonging when she finds a friend. All of these aspects of the story are so well crafted, that Rain's experience leaps off the page. Though things may not have turned out the way Rain and her parents wanted them to, they learn that love and hope can still flourish, if you take care of the weeds and then plant the seeds.

The poetry ranges from beautiful and amusing to utterly gut-wrenching. The author shares so much of her background, from her complicated upbringing with a quiet and hard-shelled mother to a compassionate but alcohol-abusing father, who was a Protestant minister haunted by his time liberating concentration camps at the end of World War II. The author's sexual assault itself isn't dwelled upon for its physical damage but for its lifelong emotional impact. There would be no Melinda and no Speak if not for Laurie's own experience as a 13-year-old looking for romance and safety and ending up with a harrowing moment of violence.\n&quot;Shout&quot; readers would ideally have already read Speak, along with one or two of the author's other works, but the memoir makes a touching introduction to her life and literary contributions. The memoir is particularly relevant, because as the writer argues, even in post- #MeToo society, rape culture and lack of consent are still prevalent. As Anderson reveals, no matter where she talks to teens, there are still always young men who ask her what the big deal is, why her protagonist is so upset when she \"liked\" the guy who raped her. On the other hand, there are still women and men (and girls and boys) who continue to struggle with their past experiences. The poems can be as short as a few lines to as long as a few pages, but the language is clear and direct, with metaphors and themes young adults will relate to or at least understand. Two of the most effective poems include one in which Anderson implores men to stop thinking they have special genitals entitled to score or win, and another implores women to think of the vast number of times they've been cat-called, touched inappropriately, abused, or assaulted and then says, \"It's not your fault.\" But they're all worth reading and processing and discussing, especially for high schoolers.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Shout","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/40519254-shout","isbn":"9781432861773","datePublished":"2019-03-12","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Laurie Halse Anderson","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Laurie_Halse_Anderson"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/shout.jpg?itok=srLuq0Uv"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Art of Losing","datePublished":"2019-03-14","description":"This is an absorbing, riveting story about addiction, family, love, and surviving.

She also captures how great it feels when you get picked for the track team or get included in your big sister's grown-up world, or when your mom shows you she really understands your problems.

December is a great character, and the story is told from her point of view. Her narrative is engaging and heart-rending, showing how kids in tough circumstances have to protect themselves emotionally. Her rich inner life is an important way for her to maintain hope for a brighter future, but the author pulls her back to reality before her delusion gets too annoying or unbelievable.

Although their personalities clash at the beginning, teens will love the strong, supportive friendships that these smart, ambitious, and talented girls form over the course of the competition.

Brave Face: A Memoir tells one particular teen's story in a frank, no-holds-barred way that deftly balances the way he sees things now, 20 years later, with the only way he was capable of seeing things in the moment, as things happened. Readers who are trying to cope with the same or similar problems will find an oasis of understanding here and be encouraged to envision a future where they belong. Readers who are having an easier time will still find a lot that's easy to relate to. They'll get a profound understanding of what depression is and does, as well as what's it's like when you don't like, and are even pretty scared of, what you think you're becoming.\nA lot of the issues Hutchinson deals with are difficult to think and talk about, let alone experience. But it's a good chance to try to start talking about how we see ourselves, what we think the future holds, what our value is as human beings, what we hope for, what our inner voice tells us, when we're OK, and when we need help. Ultimately the messages are hopeful: that it's OK to hurt, it's OK to ask for help, and that although it doesn't happen quickly or easily, it does get better. Strong language, frank sexuality, and difficult themes of self-harm and suicide make it best for teens and up.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Beach","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/andrea-beach"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Brave Face:  A Memoir","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/39348536-brave-face?from_search=true","isbn":"978-1534431515","datePublished":"2019-05-21","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Shaun David Hutchinson","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/3130410.Shaun_David_Hutchinson"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/bravefaceamemoir-book-product-image.jpg?itok=sB4XIkY-"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"A Wolf Called Wander","datePublished":"2019-07-01","description":"This vivid, fact-based narrative of orphaned yearling wolf OR-7's unusually wide travels strikes a chord in the hearts of animal-loving readers and delivers a lot of science in the process.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/a-wolf-called-wander","reviewBody":"This vivid, fact-based narrative of orphaned yearling wolf OR-7's unusually wide travels strikes a chord in the hearts of animal-loving readers and delivers a lot of science in the process.

Although the main reason Jay journeys to the Philippines is to find out how Jun died, he also learns a lot about himself and reconnects with his Filipino heritage. There are many instances where Jay is called out for being too American to truly understand what's happening in the Philippines, but part of Jay's growth and character development involves his learning how to seek out the truth and speak out when injustice is occurring.\nJay's family members grieve differently, some choosing not to show any emotion or acknowledge Jun's death, but a shocking plot twist leads to a poignant moment for the characters to mourn together.

You know, the usual, at least for Artemis and friends. Readers of the Artemis Fowl series are never bored, because Irish author Eoin Colfer always keeps his characters on the move and plotting. It's hard for Artemis to be as in control of the plotting in The Atlantis Complex as he usually is because of the fairy psychosis brewing in his brain. His mental state is yet another adversary for Artemis to face and makes him rely on friends more than usual here.\nThe main villain, Turnball, proves just as deliciously devious as Opal Kobai from earlier books, and with a surprising softer side, too. As his plans slowly unfold from his Atlantis prison cell, the old Artemis crew assembles to face him. Mulch Diggums always has a role to play, and a gassy one, along with Butler and Juliet, who have their own separate misadventures at the start of the story -- that's where the Mexican wrestling comes in. The Atlantis Complex closes with no hint of how the finale will play out, but with so much exciting fodder thus far, there's no need for spoilers.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

Ritter's engaging use of language and cliffhanger chapter endings also make it a great book to read aloud to your big kids and tweens, although sensitive listeners on the younger end of the age range may find some of it too scary to hear right before bedtime.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Beach","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/andrea-beach"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Changeling: The Oddmire, Book 1","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/40591950-changeling?from_search=true","isbn":"978-1616208394","datePublished":"2019-07-16","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"William Ritter","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/8184486.William_Ritter"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/changelingtheoddmirebook1-book-product-image.jpg?itok=3XQu7TAN"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Don't Touch My Hair!","datePublished":"2019-06-01","description":"This ALA Children's Notable Book offers a funny take on serious topics.

The plot moves along at a brisk pace with plenty of twists and turns along the way. Author Thomas Taylor's entertaining use of language, especially when it comes to people and place names; his sly sense of humor; and chapters with cliffhanger endings make it a great choice to read aloud. Sprinkled throughout are vivid illustrations that bring the story to life.\nNeither Herbie nor Violet has parents, and themes of loss are explored with sensitivity but not too deeply. Other themes include friendship, trust, and the joys and dangers of discovery. The story wraps up nicely while leaving plenty of room for more to come.

Young readers who have any of the varied differences that the 12 featured characters live with rarely see themselves portrayed with the respect and honor that Sonia Sotomayor and Rafael Lopez reserve for them in Just Ask! Be Different, Be Brave, and Be You, which will make this an especially meaningful read for such kids. Even kids who aren't living with any of the challenges that are covered will be able to connect to the characters\u2019 feelings and experiences.\nAnd the artwork is gorgeous -- vibrant, saturated colors portray detailed scenes in a vast garden and impart a sense of joy, while the kids of various ethnicities, genders, and abilities happily contribute to their joint project. Though the garden as a symbol for the beauty in human differences might go over younger kids\u2019 heads, older readers will have no problem identifying this main theme. The question at the end of each two-spread page helps kids stay engaged with both the book (and any adults reading with them). The lovely art, positive messages about asking questions\/knowing yourself, and the diversity of the characters make this a great pick for kids of all ages.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mandie Caroll","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mandie-caroll"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Just Ask!

The development of characters and relationships is a strength. Readers can empathize with Kiera's struggles to navigate her different social relationships. There's her White best friend, Harper, who, along with her brother, Tyler, occasionally trip micro-aggression minefields; Malcolm, the self-absorbed boyfriend who manipulates Kiera; Kiera's loving father, mother, and sister; and Cicada, co-creator of &quot;SLAY&quot;, with whom Kiera develops teamwork and intimacy without ever meeting face to face. The book's one minor weakness is occasional lapses into dialogue that comes off like a lecture.

She soon lands a job, finds a place to live, and gains some kind friends who look out for her and one another. But everyone's got troubles -- a broken family, abuse by a bully, a sad sense of loss as loved ones die. Whether driving an old lady named lola to bingo in an ancient car, messing with the local bully, or reminiscing about how she used to steal from her drunk mom's sleazy boyfriends, Beverly's a force to be reckoned with -- tough, vulnerable, with a strong sense of right and wrong.\n\"Beverly could think of all kinds of reasons not to trust.\n\"People leave -- that was one of the reasons.\n\"People pretended to care, but they don't, really -- that was another one.\n\"Dogs die, and your friends help you to put them in the ground.\n\"That was a big one, right there.\n\"'You can stay with me,' said Iola.

Most fans of the original Mysterious Benedict Society series would be happy to read about the intriguing quartet doing just about any old thing: hanging around the house, inventing stuff, supping on strongman Moocho Brazo's superb lasagna surrounded by a table full friends and relatives. Instead, we get the MBS out fighting the Ten Men again -- and this time Kate's an amazing shot with the tranquilizer gun. They jump out of planes and have to use their smarts to dodge traps and trick doors and a mind reader who will easily foil their plans by knowing everything they think. &quot;The Mysterious Benedict Society and the Riddle of Ages&quot; stays almost as clever as its characters, though the logic gets a little fussy at times as the story wraps.\nThe 5-year-old character, Tai, is a wonderful addition to the story and to the MBS. He brings out the best in them (Kate's playful interactions with Tai are beyond sweet) and adds a lightness and humor when things get a little scary. What a nice trick of author Trenton Lee Stewart: in keeping the MBS positive around the mind-reading Tai when things get harry, so as not to scare him, these parts of the story become less frightening for younger readers as well.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

Palacio. The author of Wonder and Auggie &amp; Me gently but unblinkingly tells a fictional story that enfolds one of humanity's greatest tragedies in the hopeful embrace of messages about the importance of kindness and speaking out against injustice. White Bird: A Wonder Story may well raise questions about how and why the Holocaust happened that are difficult, maybe even impossible to answer or understand fully. Learning about and understanding the past so that it doesn't happen again is a central theme that, along with others, can help young readers process large-scale tragic events.\nPalacio deftly weaves details about Julian's story that will be familiar to her readers, like his experience as a bully, with events in his grandmothers life -- from her complicit shunning of a classmate to her eye-opening realization that she was reviled by some not because of something she did, but because of something she was. Naturally, a story that takes place during the Holocaust has its share of tragedy and loss, which Palacio handles elegantly, but it also shows how to be a beacon of hope, how those beacons mean everything for the sake of humanity, and how readers of any age should be beacons of light themselves, whenever and however they can.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Beach","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/andrea-beach"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"White Bird: A Wonder Story","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/42898923-white-bird?from_search=true","isbn":"978-0525645535","datePublished":"2019-10-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"R.J.

Hale's bilingual narrative, told separately in Spanish and English on each page, makes this an ideal text for readers of either language. The story itself is inspirational, and the historical and cultural detail make this an excellent book choice for learning about justice and equality, past and present. Hale's bright and dreamy illustrations also beautifully add to the narrative. For example, each character in the book is given a unique face that sets each of the main characters apart as individuals.\nThis picture book begins with a nine-verse ballad, or corrido,written by Hale. It tells the story of the Lemon Grove Incident and gives readers some background before they even begin reading the story. Notes at the back of the book explains \"Los corridos,\" a bit of history, their use, and poetic structure. A history of Mexican Americans in the Lemon Grove area, along with a list of who's who in the court case, the results of the ruling, and an additional page of source notes about what happened after the ruling -- including other pivotal court rulings -- also appear at the back, along with a detailed list of sources. Here Hale also notes that illustrations for this book were inspired by vintage California citrus labels -- colorful, eye-catching labels attached to the ends of lemon crates that identified the brand, region, and product. Overall, Todos Iguales \/ All Equal is an informative nonfiction picture book that can serve as a great springboard for meaningful discussions about the immigrant experience, segregation, and the right to equal education.\nSchedule\nSchedule\nSchedule","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Monica Encarnacion","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/monica-encarnacion"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Todos Iguales \/ All Equal: Un Corrido De Lemon Grove \/ A Ballad of Lemon Grove","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/42245364-todos-iguales-all-equal","isbn":"978-0892394272","datePublished":"2019-08-13","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Christy Hale","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/121181.Christy_Hale"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/todosigualesallequal-book-image.jpg?itok=7y7cHjoj"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Jackpot","datePublished":"2019-10-17","description":"This is a fun page-turner that's best suited for mature readers due to the social and moral complexities the author presents.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/jackpot","reviewBody":"This is a fun page-turner that's best suited for mature readers due to the social and moral complexities the author presents. &quot;Jackpot&quot; doesn't shy away from the tougher issues about class in the United States.

The poor family is hardworking and diligent, with no addictions or other problems that would have caused their poverty. Wealthy men abandon their girlfriends (Black and White) and their children -- one with hush money, one without.

She forms a bond with one ghost, reluctantly, to solve a crime she knows the university is covering up. The more she digs, the more fascinating the story gets. It takes the reader in myriad directions: to many of the secret societies, a frat house, a prison, a drug den, a professor's salon, a warded safe house with a magic library, and even on the other side of the Veil. And the whole time she's missing her mentor, the gentlemanly and chivalrous Darlington, who's disappeared.

Like her other novels, this one is full of intricate historical details, a swoon-worthy, slow-burning romance, and a fully fleshed-out setting that will make readers believe they've actually visited Madrid and Vallejas or witnessed an amateur torero exhibition. While the main characters are Daniel and Anna, Sepetys weaves in the perspectives of the devout Puri and of Anna's older siblings in an organic way. Everyone's individual story is part of the heartbreaking whole, with Daniel acting as readers' clueless but well-intentioned guide into the deafening silence of life under Franco.\nWith this fourth book, Sepetys further solidifies her place at the top of YA fiction's master writers, and the preeminent historical writer for young adults. While the steamy fantasies and edgy contemporaries have their place in the space, teens, parents, and teachers should consider Sepetys' titles an automatic buy or borrow. She somehow manages to make 500+ pages fly by with a riveting story simultaneously filled with suspenseful dread and hopeful anticipation. As the pages turn, readers will fall as much for the charming and clever Spanish girl and the courageous and talented Texan boy as they do for each other. But calling the book a romance is to do it a disservice. It's a satisfying epic about so many kinds of love, from romantic to familiar, and an exploration of the important difference between patriotism and nationalism.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Fountains of Silence","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/43220998-the-fountains-of-silence","isbn":"978-0399160318","datePublished":"2019-10-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ruta Sepetys","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ruta_Sepetys"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/fountains-of-silence.jpg?itok=tFeEI1Ei"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Project Middle School: Hope: Book 1","datePublished":"2019-10-21","description":"The message here -- about navigating new situations, owning up to mistakes, being true to yourself -- starts out a little heavy handed, but the storytelling evens out as the book progresses.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/project-middle-school-hope-book-1","reviewBody":"The message here -- about navigating new situations, owning up to mistakes, being true to yourself -- starts out a little heavy handed, but the storytelling evens out as the book progresses.

Pullman himself has said he writes for both audiences at once. With Lyra at age 20 as the most important character, there are moments of rebellion and questioning and deep dissatisfaction with early adulthood that teens will relate to. Her loneliness in the world is palpable. When the story shifts to 31-year-old Malcolm, his fellow spies, refugees on boats, and the power-hungry clergy, adult readers will notice echoes of our current struggles in the world and Pullman's astute take on it all. At one point a conniving politician with closer ties to Lyra than she realizes waxes on about how to hide information. \"We should delicately and subtly undermine the idea that truth and facts are possible in the first place. Once the people have become doubtful about the truth of anything, all kinds of things will be open to us.\"\nAs this book is sandwiched in the middle of the trilogy, its job is to build in conflict that drives the finale, and it does this well on many fronts. By the end of The Secret Commonwealth, the spies are adrift, innocents are arrested, the clergy is gaining power all over Europe, Lyra's enemies are many and waiting to pounce, and we know the significance of the roses and how hard it will be to reach them before the enemy does. Very little is resolved here and, after the last 30 pages, there's more worry for Lyra than ever before. This is one finale that will be very hard to wait for.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

Stiefavter excels at writing complex characters who start off seeming one way but are actually much more multidimensional than they initially look. There are five main points of view in this new series: that of Ronan, his brother Declan, newcomers Hennessy and Jordan, as well as young Moderator Carmen. Since Carmen is in a secret squad with a mission to kill Dreamers, her perspective is the least empathetic, but as the story continues, it's clear she's not as rigid as she was in the beginning. Declan's story arc is particularly compelling, because we had seen him only as Ronan's smarmy older brother who uses fitting in and lying as a disguise to keep his family's secrets safe. Jordan is fascinating because she's an expert art forger, which becomes quite symbolic once you find out about her past.\nHennessy is a fascinating counterpart and new friend to Ronan. They bond in a way he never could have with Kavinsky in The Dream Thieves. Those who paid close attention in the earlier books will be rewarded with references and mirror scenes, but it's not completely necessary to have read the Raven Cycle to enjoy this new trilogy. What is completely necessary is to be Team \"Pynch\" (Adam Parrish and Ronan Lynch). Since Adam's away at college, they're not physically together for most of the book, but Adam always looms large in Ronan's thoughts. There was so much panic in Stiefaver's fandom that the author literally had to promise that while she enjoys making readers cry, she's not going to devastate us (i.e. break up her fans' One True Pairing). There are a lot of twists and turns in Call Down the Hawk, but as both Declan and Jordan say, it's mostly \"art and violence\" and dreams and desire.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Call Down the Hawk: The Dreamer Trilogy, Book 1","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/31373184-call-down-the-hawk","isbn":"9781338188332","datePublished":"2019-11-05","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Maggie Stiefvater","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maggie_Stiefvater"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/call-down-the-hawk.jpg?itok=jOBKXD2p"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"D\u00edas y d\u00edas \/ Days and Days","datePublished":"2019-11-01","description":"Engaging artwork explores the beauty of each season, amplifies the text, and offers many details for kids to pore over as they think about each season.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/dias-y-dias-days-and-days","reviewBody":"Engaging artwork explores the beauty of each season, amplifies the text, and offers many details for kids to pore over as they think about each season.

Jam is accepted, supported, and loved, and gets to have an adventure. She's a regular kid, relatable to any kid who feels different. The trouble in Jam's world comes not from her identity but from the fact that the adults of her town are steeped in denial about what's going on in the world. They've forgotten that ordinary humans can be monsters.

While the alphabet lends itself to the story as a structure, this book isn't about learning letters. It's about evoking pleasure and joy while reading with young children. And that it does. The often silly and always engaging commands are complimented perfectly by Ruzzier's ink-and-watercolor illustrations, which pay homage to Maurice Sendak's iconic style. The pictures ably rise to the challenge of Krauss' commands, which range from clear and simple, like \"Nod YES,\" to the poetic: \"Open your eyes, see the sea\/ Shut them fast, lock it in.\" For this latter command, Ruzzier packs the page with meditative, closed-eyed fish and sea creatures peacefully being present to a moment of beauty. There's no shortage of childlike exuberance and humor, either. Kids will love echoing the yellow-bellied red frog, arms open to the day, and its lily-pond home as it commands, \"Yell, 'Good morning, big fat world!'\" This attention to and respect for the energy, imagination, and silliness of children will make this an instant favorite for young readers and the adults in their lives.\n ","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mandie Caroll","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mandie-caroll"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Roar Like a Dandelion","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/en\/book\/show\/44023338-roar-like-a-dandelion","isbn":"978-0062680075","datePublished":"2019-10-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ruth Krauss","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/12961.Ruth_Krauss"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/roar-like-a-dandelion-book-cover-image-2.jpg?itok=-UZEVF_c"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"A Farewell to Arms","datePublished":"2019-11-04","description":"Hemingway's genius rested in his carefully crafted, deceptively simple sentences.  &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, in particular, may be easy to read, but it's not easy to take.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/a-farewell-to-arms","reviewBody":"Hemingway's genius rested in his carefully crafted, deceptively simple sentences. &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, in particular, may be easy to read, but it's not easy to take.

The 17th century France-like setting, where women and people of color lead, same- and opposite-sex love are equally accepted, and angels are summoned for magical help in everything from the mundane, like cleaning, to the extraordinary, such as reviving a life, never feels forced or uneasy. They are just the facts of life for this book. The characters are well drawn and interesting. Simeon, the imposing and attractive doctor, saves the day repeatedly.

From the first page, when we meet &quot;Truman&quot; as he sits on a napkin adorably munching on a miniature tortoise-sized donut, there's a lot to love. Their apartment is a refuge from the loud, roaring city below. &quot;Truman&quot; shows genuine concern when Sarah leaves him behind. Readers will recognize his child-like devotion to Sarah and relate to his missing her. When he decides he must find her, he uses the resources in his environment (rocks, cushions, a boot, etc.) to begin his journey. Then, when he encounters the unsettling vastness of the living room rug, he stops, thinks, and musters up the courage to go on.\nThe gouache, brush marker, charcoal, colored pencil, and digitally drawn art is simple and evocative. The reunion spread is particularly luminous, with &quot;Truman&quot; glowing in a sun-like halo that communicates how special he is to Sarah as well as the bigness of his accomplishment.

The melodic text and speech in &quot;What Is Given from the Heart&quot; is pleasing to the ear. This testament to the love between a mother and her son and the power of faith and community is a stunning reflection of one aspect of African American culture. The soft and luminous folk art\/found art illustrations capture the details of the story in moving scenes. Particularly wonderful are those of James Otis embracing his mother as she mourns, the gorgeous spread that shows African American congregants walking to church together in their colorful Sunday best, and the joyous depiction of James Otis catching snow on his tongue as his mother has her arms open in wonder and smiles up to the sky. This is a not-to-be-missed treasure from an iconic storyteller and talented fine artist.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mandie Caroll","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mandie-caroll"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"What Is Given from the Heart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/en\/book\/show\/40640773-what-is-given-from-the-heart","isbn":"978-0375836152","datePublished":"2019-12-20","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Patricia C.

The &quot;Captain Underpants Series&quot; combines eye-popping illustrations and paragraphs full of fun, vocabulary-expanding words, and tells an adventure tale with characters many kids can relate to. Author Dav Pilkey struggled in school, his undiagnosed ADHD making it hard for him to sit and focus the way other students could. Cartooning became his outlet, and his stories of underdogs are both silly and remarkably complex. The characters' names are all plays on words and phrases, and the good-vs.-evil plots balance humor and action with empathy and empowerment.

With every new development in &quot;Clean Getaway&quot;, readers learn more about the lives and emotions of Scoob and his grandmother. The tension rises steeply through one clever cliffhanger after another. A particular strength of the book is the way author Nic Stone weaves in civil rights history without ever seeming like she's lecturing or preaching: The conversations between the boy and his grandmother are realistic. She tells him anecdotes from her life, and then the two connect those stories and the sites they're seeing with his history lessons from school. Stone also does an excellent job of presenting this family as loving and supportive (and the boy as feeling loved), even as serious family problems are gradually revealed. She's previously published young adult novels, and this middle-grade debut is strong. \nCartoon-style illustrations by Dawud Anyabwile do a great job reflecting the emotional depth of the text. This book could be a good choice for a reader who's relatively new to chapter books. It can also help parents, grandparents, or even older siblings share personal stories about historical events with young readers.

The market with gumball machines at its entrance and pi\u00f1ata hanging outside, the neighborhood \"tortiller\u00eda,\" the familiar sound of the \"raspados\" handcart rolling down the street -- all things that connect us to living in a community and makes this a story that Latinx kids can easily relate to and enjoy. A celebration of working-class people, the brown-skinned characters depicted in vibrant illustrations are every Latinx kid's dad, grandparents, and neighbors. The vibrant comic-like illustrations quickly draw readers into the story through motion and sounds and stir up cultural nostalgia. A realistic linguistic mix is also part of the illustrations and includes Spanish words sprinkled into easy-to-follow dialogue that's presented in speech bubbles, alongside English-only text.\nAn author's note at the back of the book reveals Quintero's inspiration and gives details about her fondest childhood memories.

The timeline focuses on Katherine's early life as a math whiz kid, grade-skipper and her early college admittance, marriage and kids, and impressive career at NASA through John Glen's 1962 orbit of the earth, for which she calculated flight paths. The story doesn't emphasize or ignore the racism and sexism she faced, but emphasizes her brilliance and indispensability to NASA.\nThe book does not explain how Black women came to work at Langley as human computers, which would have been welcome as a part of the historical context.

Author Nikki Grimes' words often verge on the poetic, with gems like, \"Your bookshelf is noisy with stories,\" and \"you yawn and grind your teeth like a squirrel ready to nibble the night.\" Young readers of &quot;Bedtime for Sweet Creatures&quot; will recognize themselves in the toddler's delay tactics and susceptibility to parental tricks (like using Bear to get the tot in bed), and parents will relate to the mom's endless summoning of patience. Illustrator Elizabeth Zunon's colorfully collaged backgrounds and patterned, abstract imaginary animals make this book shine; it's worth owning just for the art. Expressive faces capture the drama of bedtime, and the animals come off as sweet and wily as the child.\nOne quibble is that the dad doesn't help with (or take on) bedtime. In fact, he in relaxes on the couch with a book while mom tackles the challenge, an image which may reinforce traditional gender roles in parenting for young children. Despite this critique, it\u2019s a truly wonderful story with great art that readers of all ages are likely to enjoy.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mandie Caroll","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mandie-caroll"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Bedtime for Sweet Creatures","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/37572178-bedtime-for-sweet-creatures","isbn":"978-1492638322","datePublished":"2020-01-14","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nikki Grimes","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/25492.Nikki_Grimes"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/bedtime-for-sweet-creatures-book-cover-image.jpg?itok=eCT560Ng"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"We Had to Be Brave: Escaping the Nazis on the Kindertransport","datePublished":"2020-01-28","description":"Told through the eyes of the children who lived it, the story offers readers a chance to imagine themselves in the midst of an often overlooked chapter in history.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/we-had-to-be-brave-escaping-the-nazis-on-the-kindertransport","reviewBody":"Told through the eyes of the children who lived it, the story offers readers a chance to imagine themselves in the midst of an often overlooked chapter in history.

Nic's journey in &quot;Double Bass Blues&quot; is thrilling to watch unfold. As he walks, buses, and walks again to get into the city, Nic gracefully shrugs off bullies, keeps the sounds of the rain and windshield wipers in his head, and walks up stairway after stairway with that heavy bass. His arrival in the arms of his granddaddy is a long sigh of relief, and the realization that Nic is not the first musician in his bloodline to a refuge built of family, music and love.\nWith only about 30 words and 13 lines of dialogue, Rudy Gutierrez's stunning art does a lot of the story's heavy lifting. His swooping curved lines and sharp jagged edges evoke the different moods of Nic's journey. And the way Nic's face and hair coloring changes slightly from spread to spread captures the beauty of Blackness. This book is bursting with music, dedication, the importance of family, and Black excellence. Young readers will be able to connect on one or more levels, but this wonderful boy with his beloved bass is bound to steal the hearts of all.

The story also sweeps across history, acknowledging the Native people who cared for the land before Africans were chained and brought to the continent, and the stain of segregationist Jim Crow laws.\nDaniel Minter's gorgeous illustrations link this American family to Africa in its details: Patterns in clothing and animals reflect traditional textile designs, Granny's cowry shell earrings call to mind coastal Africa, and stamped on every page in the background are West African adinkra symbols. The farm staples of okra, watermelon, and cotton are drawn in white and overlay sumptuous reds, oranges, and yellows or vibrant greens and soothing blues. The last picture, featuring Granny's dress and her outstretched hand, may stay with readers the longest. Maybe she's feeding her chickens, or maybe she's offering readers her love like they are family, too.

A bittersweet paean to eccentricity and nonconformity, it is also a scathing commentary on teenagers, which makes its popularity with them all the more interesting.\nLike much of Spinelli's best work, it straddles the line between reality and fantasy, dwelling in the land of legend and allegory. Spinelli himself says, in an interview printed in the back of the book, \"the character [is] intended to raise dust in the corners of credibility, to challenge our routine ways of seeing ourselves.\" It does that -- it's hard to imagine young teens reading this and not having to think hard about their friends, actions, and the outcasts in their own world.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Stargirl","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=ha07QkgXSvsC","isbn":"978-0440416777","datePublished":"2003-09-07","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jerry Spinelli","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jerry_Spinelli"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/1496-orig.jpg?itok=7klQV0PI"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The River Between Us","datePublished":"2003-09-16","description":"Rarely has war in general, and the Civil War in particular, been portrayed so clearly and realistically for young readers.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-river-between-us","reviewBody":"Rarely has war in general, and the Civil War in particular, been portrayed so clearly and realistically for young readers. Perhaps only in Gary Paulsen's Soldier's Heart, which spanned the war and many battles. Peck offers not a sweeping view, but rather a sliver -- the hospital and camp in Cairo just before the Battle of Belmont. It's an ugly sight, and not one that will leave any reader in doubt about the glory of war. When they arrive, Noah is sick with dysentery, but getting him well may be a mistake -- health is a ticket into hell.\nAll of this is done with Peck's trademark razor-edged prose. Few modern authors, for adults or children, wield a pen with the surgical precision Peck brings to every sentence.

Former teacher Andrew Clements had already rocketed to the upper reaches of the best middle-grade authors list on the strength of his first novel, Frindle, and two follow-ups, The Landry News and The Janitor's Boy. This story is longer and a bit more complex than the others (though still well within the reach of middle and upper elementary children), but it shares with them a deep understanding of the world of school (and now of publishing), exceptionally clever stories, wickedly sharp characterizations, and a perfection in plotting that makes them akin to caper novels.\nReaders will grin from beginning to end of this enchanting story, except when brushing away the occasional tear during the more poignant moments, such as when Zoe realizes that Natalie's story, ostensibly about a girl who is caught cheating at school, is really \"like a good-bye poem from Natalie to her father,\" who died when she was young.\nThe author's prose, filled with witty tidbits such as pleasing mirror-image portraits of the two heroines, is so clear that illustrations aren't really necessary. But illustrator Brian Selznick has added his own clever touches. The ending, too, is pure magic, as Zoe manipulates events to a glorious conclusion that only she has envisioned. Andrew Clements has found a niche that he fills better than anyone, and any child can tell you that there is an infinite variety of school stories to be told. Let's hope he writes many more.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The School Story","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=Ip0U2rdS2egC","isbn":"978-0689851865","datePublished":"2001-06-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrew Clements","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andrew_Clements"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/1748-orig.jpg?itok=LIvrVitz"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The True Story of Christmas","datePublished":"2003-11-17","description":"As Lemony Snicket might say on the back of one of his books: If, Dear Reader, you're looking for a heartwarming, happy Christmas book, full of love and the season's glad tidings, this isn't it.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-true-story-of-christmas","reviewBody":"As Lemony Snicket might say on the back of one of his books: If, Dear Reader, you're looking for a heartwarming, happy Christmas book, full of love and the season's glad tidings, this isn't it.

Because the author is tracing the influences on the young Darwin, both familial and cultural, however, the amount of information pertinent to the story could be overwhelming. Sis has developed a signature style perfectly suited to such a challenge. The illustrations are packed with pictures of people important to the story, with relevant scenes, and with additional writing that helps illuminate the story. Underneath the illustrations text runs in two and sometimes three fonts so that the reader can trace Charles Darwin's public life, private life, and what the author calls, secret life. The secret life in Darwin's case was the development of his revolutionary theory of evolution, work to which only a select few were privy.\nOne is left with a clear sense of the personal life of this famous man, from the difficulties that he had convincing his more conventional father to allow him to pursue his professional passion to his full family life with a wife and 10 children.

It's a form that can be awkward and even silly if not handled well, and too often the form and subject don't match, making the reader wonder why the author chose to write the story this way. But rarely, if ever, have form and subject matched as perfectly as they do here.\nThe reason for the poetry is part of the story -- it starts as assignments from a fifth-grade teacher, and then takes on a life of its own as Lonnie discovers his talent -- and his voice. He has suffered great loss, but his life is improving, and his chronicle of past and present is powerfully poignant as he tries out a number of poetic forms, and comments on the art of writing as well as his life and thoughts.

Its richness of language and metaphorical meaning, as well as its three-dimensional and evolving characters, are well summed up in a line from the end of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species, which the author quotes near the end of the book: \"From so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\"\nThe beautiful and wonderful forms that evolve here are the characters and their relationships and viewpoints, all complex, and all undergoing change. There's Turner, of course, struggling to live up to his father's teachings even when his father doesn't; Mrs. Cobb, a crusty old racist who learns to love a black girl and an ill-mannered boy; Willis, who seems to be a bully but has an ironclad sense of what's right; his father, Deacon Hurd, whose pride goeth before a fall; and many others, a Dickensian wealth of real characters. And evolution is not just individual -- the relationships and understandings between the characters change, and change again. This lovely, heartbreaking, and very real story doesn't always go where you think it will, but in the end it goes to a movingly spiritual place.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=xVQ7t8L53D0C","isbn":"978-0375841699","datePublished":"2005-03-20","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Gary D.

It's told through the eyes of the 9-year-old son of the commandant at Auschwitz, a boy who has no clue as to what is going on around him. This perspective allows readers to feel a strong sense of foreboding, long before they know the extent of the terror surrounding Bruno's world. Readers will be struck by the contrast between Bruno's normalcy and naivety, and the extreme horrors of the time.\nReaders will quickly relate to Bruno, who is uprooted from his home and moved somewhere \"nasty and cold\" where he has no friends; he is lonely, his sister bugs him, and adults treat him as if he's not there. He wants to study art and read fantasy books rather than history and geography. He wants to get outside and explore.

And Peter, whose serenity and grace David both loves and envies.\nAnd then there's David\/Justin, whose yearning, need, and misery flirt with, but never cross over into, tedium; who can't see the love that surrounds him; and who, though so perceptive, understands less than everyone else. Even Fate has a sort of edgy compassion for his victims here.

He teaches Philip, and the reader, more by example than by overt instruction.\nPart of the point of any survival novel is that the protagonist returns changed, having learned a kind of self-reliance that can't be learned in civilization, and that is certainly true here.

Yet it's moving, funny, lyrical, and has powerful appeal for both children and adults. Jerry Spinelli gives his readers a careful, at times humorous, portrait of a kid who is only special to his family, and scatters penetrating insights into growing up along the way. Zinkoff's (no one calls him Donald except his teachers) mistakes and quirks are endearing, since we're seeing them from the inside. And his one real talent, a sunny disposition, keeps his life from seeming cruel when he's not picked for teams, when he's ridiculed and taunted, when he, in short, loses, again and again.\nThis type of story, of course, has been done often before, though rarely with Spinelli's wit and craft. And we all know the formula -- eventually there will be some great dramatic event, the hero will have his moment to shine, and everyone will realize that he's not a &quot;Loser&quot; at all. But that doesn't happen here. There's a moment when it might, but it's not something a Zinkoff, or a real child, can pull off. And therein lies Spinelli's unusual point -- not that &quot;Loser&quot;s are really winners, or I'm ok, you're ok, but that the measuring sticks we chose may not be the only ones there are. And Spinelli has the courage to stick to his point right to the end -- no &quot;Loser&quot;s or winners, no heroes or villains, no happy endings or sad ones, just children, and their confusing ability occasionally to connect.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Loser","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=GD_WK2DrkzMC","isbn":"978-0756915575","datePublished":"2003-12-28","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jerry Spinelli","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jerry_Spinelli"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/1896-orig.jpg?itok=hrFubjrY"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Moon Plane","datePublished":"2006-08-28","description":"Every kid will relate to the imaginative young boy who sees himself soaring above cars, trains, and boats, going further and further into outer space -- all the way to the moon.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/moon-plane","reviewBody":"Every kid will relate to the imaginative young boy who sees himself soaring above cars, trains, and boats, going further and further into outer space -- all the way to the moon.

At times, however, the time-traveling sequences are subtle and hard to follow.\nThe characters in &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot; are more fully developed than those in the first book in the series, and many readers skip the first book entirely. Will struggles with his new identity, and readers see him mature: \"Will was instantly a furious Old One, so furious that he did not pause to think what he should do.\" Both Merriman and Will are relentless in their shared quest, and Hawkin, the tragic Walker, whose Judas-like behavior sentences him to walk the earth for centuries, painfully shows how he is a casualty of the struggle between good and evil.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tara L.

The first is the focus of the text. Rather than a simple retelling of the known events of her life, this is instead a somewhat fictionalized account of Tubman's spiritual journey. As told in the swirling, lyrical writing, filled with rhythm and internal rhyme, these are her conversations with God, whose voice she hears in the breeze and the songs of birds, whose face she sees reflected in moonlight on swamp water. The book consists primarily of these conversations, before, during, and after her flight, laid out in clever typography that enhances the meaning.\nThe second is the artwork, a series of two-page, borderless paintings that are nothing short of spectacular. Clear, vivid, bathed in light even in the darkness, they accent the spirituality and add a powerful emotional expressiveness to the book. Combined with the poetic text, the images create a musical quality; a chanted spiritual of uplift and veneration that turns this oft-told historical tale into something more. It's more than just the tale of a brave woman freeing slaves, it's a testament to something that engages the heart and senses, as well as the mind, and hums in the soul long after the cover is closed.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Moses: When Harriet Tubman Led Her People to Freedom","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/107465.Moses","isbn":"978-0786851751","datePublished":"2006-09-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carole Boston Weatherford","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carole_Boston_Weatherford"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/6312-orig.jpg?itok=rX_FcHMv"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"How the Grinch Stole Christmas","datePublished":"2004-03-09","description":"Dr.  Seuss subtly exposes greed and commercialism and promotes the values of love and community with wit, humor, and flawlessly constructed rhymes.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/how-the-grinch-stole-christmas","reviewBody":"Dr. Seuss subtly exposes greed and commercialism and promotes the values of love and community with wit, humor, and flawlessly constructed rhymes.

There's a very rare and wonderful writer's trick that only a very few authors have ever been able to pull off, in which a silly and essentially meaningless (outside the book) phrase is, by the power of the writing and story, turned into something not only meaningful, but powerfully emotional. Harper Lee did it with \"Hey, Boo.\" Patricia MacLachlan did it with \"Rock, paper, scissors.\" And now Deborah Wiles does it with \"I got a toad to swallow.\"\nThis kind of writing is a palimpsest, in which the story is just the top layer, the carrier wave, of something far richer and deeper -- in this case the haunting, aching beauty of a child struggling to grow. The story is one that most kids will love. It's funny, at times silly, with warmly delineated characters (many of whom have appeared in the author's two other novels), and some great sports action.

In that way it's more similar to the non-island survival story, My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George.

Ezra Keats is remarkable in his ability to create a calming yet vibrant story, striking this balance gracefully in pictures and in text. His artwork is spare yet the pictures burst with brilliant color and expression. In many of the pictures, Peter lacks facial features except his eyes, but Keats manages, with the angle of his head and the composition, to convey feeling.\nThe text, similarly economical, is made up of just enough words to tell the story -- none of them too hard for a young reader to sound out or for a young listener to understand -- and they are vivid words used powerfully, often rhyming or repeating. The result is that kids (and parents too!) can settle into Peter's snowy world.

When &quot;Whistle for Willie&quot; was first published in 1964, few books featured African-American characters. Keats himself was born to struggling immigrant white Jewish parents, grew up poor in tenement Brooklyn, and is able to peer through Peter's eyes to show us an urban neighborhood full of found wonder. A curious cat peers out a barbershop window. Two girls -- one black, one white -- share a jump rope. Graffiti's pictured as stenciled stars, arrows, numbers, and letters spelling out the simple words \"cat\" and \"me.\" If play's the work of the child, Peter's an expert, spinning till he's dizzy, hiding in boxes from his dog, and drawing a chalk line everywhere he walks. There's also touching sweetness when he tries on his dad's hat and pretends to be his dad while his mom plays along.\nKeats' art was also innovative, using colorful mixed-media collage with patterned, marbled, and textured papers. When Peter triumphantly shows his parents he can whistle, Keats fills the page with Peter's proud, joyful face.

You can trust Steig's instinct for language, story, and illustration to bring your child a magical combination. Simple, cartoonlike drawings of the animals' world (thick black line, thin watercolor) turn magically complex with Tiffky's visit to the dump. All invoke key action at every twist and turn of plot, and you could almost decipher the story just from the pictures -- but you'd miss half the fun!\nSteig's trademark language play is in full swing with Tiffky's every adventure. Steig subtly adds several lessons: One man's garbage is Tiffky's treasure, his furnishings, his wardrobe. Hear that, consumer kids? And early in the book, there's a visual clue to the identity of his lady love.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kevin McCaffrey","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/kevin-mccaffrey"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Tiffky Doofky","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/726907.Tiffky_Doofky","isbn":"978-0374477486","datePublished":"2000-01-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"William Steig","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/26874.William_Steig"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/1977-orig.jpg?itok=TYEvGP0B"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Sylvester and the Magic Pebble","datePublished":"2003-09-04","description":"Once again, Steig addresses one of childhood's biggest latent fears, abandonment, but his gentle, unerring handling of this issue makes for an endearing story full of pathos and strength.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/sylvester-and-the-magic-pebble","reviewBody":"Once again, Steig addresses one of childhood's biggest latent fears, abandonment, but his gentle, unerring handling of this issue makes for an endearing story full of pathos and strength. Steig's belief in the magic (mysteries) of life is central to this story, both in creating the anxious situation and relieving it. Steig won the Caldecott Medal for children's-book illustration for this book, and while it's a good choice to recognize within Steig's body of work, with its attention to detail and bright colors, it is no more stunning than many other children's books. It is Steig's deserving style and sensitive attention to faces in all his work that was probably given tribute then.\nAs a package, this book offers the same classic satisfaction of most of Steig's works. So much feeling and nuance stuffed into the simple story and pictures of this little book will make children appreciate the power of books and convince their parents that books should be collected and read over and over.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kevin McCaffrey","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/kevin-mccaffrey"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Sylvester and the Magic Pebble","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/457762.Sylvester_and_the_Magic_Pebble","isbn":"978-1442435605","datePublished":"2000-01-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"William Steig","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/26874.William_Steig"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/1475-orig.jpg?itok=KdJU-s3h"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"I Lost My Bear","datePublished":"2003-07-17","description":"Jules Feiffer's seamless blend of scribbled text and cartoon art captures every nuance of the young heroine's feelings.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/i-lost-my-bear","reviewBody":"Jules Feiffer's seamless blend of scribbled text and cartoon art captures every nuance of the young heroine's feelings.

Wryly observant of early 20th-century manners, fiercely independent but secretly eager to belong, Blossom tells her story as she lives her life, with common sense and humor. Neither a knife-throwing ghost nor the sudden fame that follows her Titanic vision fazes Blossom. The episodic plot filled with endearing supporting characters is similar to novels written a hundred years ago. The language is old-fashioned, too (\"Whether you be born with the Gift or attain it is often debated\"), and is an excellent stepping-stone for kids ready to jump into classic literature.\nJust as Beverly Cleary did with Ramona (who appeared in Henry Huggins), Richard Peck makes Blossom Culp, a supporting character in The Ghost Belonged to Me, the heroine of its sequel. It's a wise choice, too; Blossom stole many scenes in the earlier novel, and her funny, matter-of-fact narration enables &quot;Ghosts I Have Been&quot; to include scarier moments without losing its lightheartedness.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Norah Caroline Piehl","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/norah-caroline-piehl"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Ghosts I Have Been","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/1146093.Ghosts_I_Have_Been","isbn":"978-0141310961","datePublished":"1977-01-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Richard Peck","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Richard_Peck_(writer)"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/1921-orig.jpg?itok=clfuHW7-"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Leonardo da Vinci","datePublished":"2004-03-10","description":"Diane Stanley's &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; is every parent's answer to the problem of dry, boring biographies.

Written as a rebuttal to William Golding's Lord of the Flies, according to the author's son in his introduction, this is a disturbing but ultimately uplifting book. The boys in this book don't degenerate into beasts, as in Lord of the Flies. Instead, they liberate the beasts and themselves, though their leader sacrifices himself to accomplish that goal.\nGlendon Swarthout's often-poetic prose elevates the kids' quest into an epic, and his descriptions of the boys and their trials become almost hypnotic. Some see it as a Christian allegory. However, most teens reading for enjoyment will want to skip the lengthy reader's supplement in the back of the book, which provides school-like discussion questions.

He knows how to engage young readers without sacrificing content or literary style. Freedman does enough research to write a scholarly adult work, but carefully chooses material that will hold a young adult's attention. Eleanor Roosevelt was a complex woman who faced as many emotional challenges as political ones, and Freedman offers readers a well-rounded view of Roosevelt that is not shaded in hero worship. Boys may not be able to identify as easily as girls do with Roosevelt's struggles as a plain-looking girl, a young wife and mother dependent on her husband and his family, and an intelligent woman wanting to break through confining social traditions -- but both girls and boys will come away understanding Roosevelt's strengths (compassion, energy, open-mindedness) and her self-professed weaknesses (emotional intensity, a somber attitude, and no-nonsense mothering).\nDespite a few points of history that could use more explanation -- the October 1929 stock market crash, for example -- Freedman presents a lively view of a vivid chapter in U.S. history. This biography is as much an interesting leisure-time book as it is a classroom history text.

It's truly one of the finest children's novels ever written. Only once in a great while does a book with this kind of power come along. It has all the elements of the ideal children's book: a riveting plot, a powerfully sympathetic main character, and an intriguing point of view. But it goes far beyond the usual children's literature, with layers of intellectual and emotional depth that keep readers coming back to it again and again.\nDavid's first encounters with such things as bright colors, a bath, and good people are touching and, amazingly, exciting. His convictions are well reasoned and often cause young readers to evaluate their own ideas about suiting their actions to their beliefs. Many children at this age find in David a unique role model whose goodness comes from indomitable strength and courage. The reader sees through David's fresh eyes the ordinary things of everyday life. An orange, a beautiful landscape, a school, all suddenly appear as the miracles they are. And as David constructs his own relationship with \"the God of the green pastures and still waters\" from fragments of the Bible and his own perception of the world, the reader hears the ancient words anew. &quot;North to Freedom&quot; is hard to put down, and harder to forget.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"North to Freedom","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=p2DF73rKmE0C","isbn":"978-0152575533","datePublished":"1969-12-31","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Anne Holm","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anne_Holm"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/1256-orig.jpg?itok=12OwIOq6"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Morning Girl","datePublished":"2004-08-13","description":"This beautiful and powerful short novel makes a distant culture familiar and its loss quietly devastating.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/morning-girl","reviewBody":"This beautiful and powerful short novel makes a distant culture familiar and its loss quietly devastating.

He slides rapidly down the slope of the ends justifying the means, which are increasingly dishonest.\nFinally, Marty's choices narrow to trying to decide on the lesser of evils, rather than choosing what is clearly right, and in the end the biggest lesson the book seems to teach is that nothing is as simple as it seems.

And the message is clear and moving: Life can be extremely tough at times, but we will be just fine if we keep on the road and tackle each challenge as it presents itself.\nThough Dr. Seuss was still alive when this book was published, some critics sensed it was his last. It does seem like a retrospective of his career: Horton-like elephants parade the hero triumphantly along, carrying flapping banners or canopies. A psychedelic interior decorated with billowy, colorful stripes resembles a circus tent, bringing back memories of If I Ran the Circus.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Robyn Raymer","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/robyn-raymer"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Oh, the Places You'll Go!","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=Iqm0QW-GkUkC","isbn":"978-0679805274","datePublished":"1990-01-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dr. Seuss","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dr._Seuss"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/1761-orig.jpg?itok=ohvHScN8"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World: The Extraordinary True Story of Shackleton and the Endurance","datePublished":"2003-08-20","description":"This unbelievable story -- the subject of numerous books, articles, and even a museum exhibition -- is enhanced by Jennifer Armstrong's breathtaking prose.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/shipwreck-at-the-bottom-of-the-world-the-extraordinary-true-story-of-shackleton-and-the","reviewBody":"This unbelievable story -- the subject of numerous books, articles, and even a museum exhibition -- is enhanced by Jennifer Armstrong's breathtaking prose.

It's a heavy topic but one handled admirably by author-illustrator Peter Sis, who in The Wall intersperses excerpts from his journal with straightforward third-person narration and detailed illustrations. Sis knew he was an artist at a very early age. You see the way his art was shaped by the events around him as he grew up, and yet it also allowed him to wrest free of those cultural constraints. His meticulous pen and ink illustrations invite close attention. The use of splashes of color -- particularly the blood red representing communism -- is arresting and effective.\nThe history of that time was dense, and kids may need help understanding what was happening in the rest of the world at the time. They may also miss some of the touchstones that meant so much to Sis: bands like the Rolling Stones and tie-dying shirts. They might wonder why long hair was such a big deal, too.

Bright, sunshine-at-last colors eventually take over, and Rover's final joyous romp across the yard is an adorable way to tie up the story.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dawn Friedman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/dawn-friedman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Move Over, Rover!","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/124114.Move_Over_Rover_","isbn":"978-0152019792","datePublished":"2006-09-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Karen Beaumont","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/63357.Karen_Beaumont"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/6353-orig.jpg?itok=WG2G0WF3"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Revolution Is Not a Dinner Party","datePublished":"2008-02-21","description":"As a storybook heroine, Ling is very relatable; her determined defiance of the bullies and Red Guards is admirable, exciting, and satisfying.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/revolution-is-not-a-dinner-party","reviewBody":"As a storybook heroine, Ling is very relatable; her determined defiance of the bullies and Red Guards is admirable, exciting, and satisfying. The events of the book, carefully described so as not to be too overwhelming to the younger reader, often seem like escapades or adventures. Her growth in maturity and inner strength makes this as much a coming-of-age novel as an historical one. All of these features make it an excellent introduction for upper elementary and middle school readers to this frightening period in Chinese history.\nTo a Western child growing up in comfort and privilege, stories of the Chinese Cultural Revolution can be hard to understand as history. It can seem more like a tale of an insane asylum where the inmates have taken over, and the lack of sense and logic can be almost as frightening as the violence. Compestine's decision to fictionalize her memoir was a good one; it makes the history far more approachable than, say, a book such as Red Scarf Girl: A Memoir of the Cultural Revolution by Ji-li Jiang, which is more realistic but, by the same token, harder to relate to. &quot;Revolution Is Not a Dinner Party&quot; won many awards, including the California Book Award for Young Adult Fiction, made the 2007 Publisher's Weekly Best Children's Fiction list, and was named one of the American Library Association's Best Books for Young Adults in 2008, and was nominated for the California Young Readers Medal in 2012.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Revolution Is Not a Dinner Party","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=P1nG8Ji35CQC","isbn":"978-0312581497","datePublished":"2007-08-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ying Chang Compestine","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/80864.Ying_Chang_Compestine"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/revolution-is-not.jpg?itok=ETrGsIzE"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Wee Free Men","datePublished":"2004-12-10","description":"Pratchett has an uncanny ability to create an unusual and creative adventure.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-wee-free-men","reviewBody":"Pratchett has an uncanny ability to create an unusual and creative adventure.

Whenever they're on stage, the story fairly sizzles with wit and invention. Equally wonderful, though in a very different way, are the flashbacks to Tiffany's Granny Aching, an old sheepherder whose hardheaded wisdom is the product of a life lived in the chalk hills, and is reflected in her granddaughter.

There are three true things that can be said about J.D. Salinger's masterpiece: It is one of the great works of American literature, it is one of the most frequently challenged by would-be book-banners, and, therefore, it is one of the most misunderstood books of the 20th century. It has been challenged and banned for all of the reasons mentioned above in the content advisories. But those who challenge it fail to see the forest for the little swearword trees. They have called Holden a cynical teenager, when in fact he's such a compassionate innocent abroad that he can hardly cope with the cynical world at all: He's so innocent and so alone that he tries to get a prostitute to just chat and keep him company (alas, no heart of gold here). Desperately lonely, adrift in what seems to him an uncaring world, he has been through some terrible experiences, and no one at all seems to have noticed that he's crumbling.\nIt's true that much of it is somewhat dated now. Yet there's a reason this book has stayed in print, is stocked in nearly every bookstore, and has been assigned in nearly every high school for the past 60-plus years: Its emotional power and poignancy are still as strong as ever, and Holden's inner self is just as recognizable to teens today as it has ever been. This is one of those books that everyone should read as a teen. At a time (1951) when \"teen\" and \"adolescent\" were barely concepts in the American mind, Salinger captured the adolescent voice and way of thinking more perfectly -- and more poignantly -- than just about anyone before or since.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Liz Perle","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/liz-perle"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Catcher in the Rye","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=JCdFCQAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-0316769532","datePublished":"1969-12-31","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"J.

Children too seldom have the opportunity to hear the power of the English language in the hands of a great master, and in a form that is meant for them, that doesn't leave them behind, but catches them up and carries them along.\nThe second pleasure lies in the images of holiday celebrations long ago: the details, at once alien and yet oddly familiar and recognizable; the humor and warmth of family and friends; and the vividness of the little set pieces that lodge immediately in the mind and memory.

First, it's laugh-out-loud, still-chuckling-10-minutes-later funny, the kind of clever, sardonic, intelligent humor that will have your teens calling up their friends to read passages out loud. The humor, though, is set in high relief by the story's depth, complexity, and sophistication. There's a realism here that goes far beyond most books, either for teens or for adults. All the characters, major and minor, are more than meet the eye, and the layers of their personalities don't always fit together as smoothly as they usually do in fiction. Their lives are as complex as their personalities.\nVery few ends are neatly tied up, but unlike most books that try this, it isn't frustrating at all -- in fact it makes perfect sense. Interspersed with all the plot intricacies are Tom's, and the author's, musings, bits of philosophy, rants, and outsider observations, often wickedly funny and always interesting and thought-provoking.

It's notable for the tender care the author lavishes on her main characters, and for the honest portrayal of a child's grief and a child's capacity for creating beauty from tragedy. Jesse's life can be a struggle -- especially with four sisters and a need to hide his passion for drawing. But author Katherine Paterson gives voice to his fears and hopes without imposing judgment or commentary.\nReaders will find much common ground with the protagonists. Jesse, though often annoyed by his sisters, tries to be kind, and sympathizes with his overworked mother. Leslie, the only child of wealthy, intellectual parents who sometimes forgets she's a child, knows what it's like to be an outsider. Though the last part of the book deals with death and its aftermath, this is ultimately a richly uplifting story of a boy and a girl who become friends despite their differences.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Amy Finley","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/amy-finley"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Bridge to Terabithia","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=jEdNOQhEHNcC&printsec=frontcover","isbn":"978-0060734015","datePublished":"1977-01-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Katherine Paterson","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Katherine_Paterson"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/1016-orig.jpg?itok=ZNivgb5a"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Zen Shorts","datePublished":"2006-05-12","description":"The beautiful watercolor and ink illustrations, like the stories, are deceptively simple, but a careful examination will reveal small details that reinforce the Asian inspiration.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/zen-shorts","reviewBody":"The beautiful watercolor and ink illustrations, like the stories, are deceptively simple, but a careful examination will reveal small details that reinforce the Asian inspiration.

The whole volume, in fact, is a treat, printed in perfectly sized type with plenty of white space on creamy paper -- a beautiful edition well worth the slightly higher hardcover price.

Mr. Poppers Penguins is a good fit for most first- and second-grade readers, and can be read aloud to kindergartners.\nThough the book was written in 1938, Mr. Popper was ahead of his time for progressive parenting, letting his kids leave school to help him take the penguin act on the road.

Already turned into a movie this delightful and thought-provoking story succeeds on several levels. Damian is surely one of the most poignantly endearing narrators in a while. He wants so badly to be good and do right, and he's so completely clueless. Like Huck Finn, he tells the reader far more than he understands himself, and his imagination or visions or whatever you think they are (the author is deliberately vague) are blurring the line between fantasy and reality.\nBut in addition to the humor, poignancy, and suspense, this story has intellectual depth as well. As the boys start spreading the wealth around their school and town, they inadvertently change the economy of the schoolyard. And while a 250,000 pounds is a lot of money, it's not unlimited, and there are so many needs out there. As one boy struggles to do what's right, another struggles to satisfy all his appetites, and the whole town wants a piece, many important and topical issues are raised.

That's because its themes are universal and timeless: It will inspire readers to think about how we should make and keep friends, and how we should treat each other. Though most readers will cry near the end, it's never maudlin or sappy. Indeed, it's New Yorker editor and author E.B. White's avoidance of cuteness, astringent prose, whimsical humor, and matter-of-factness about life-and-death issues that sets &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; apart from the pack.\nHis heroine is a hairy spider who sucks the blood out of flies, aided by a rat, and they're working to save Wilbur from the reality of every working barn. Kind people can be ugly and sometimes cruel, others can be greedy but helpful, snooty but caring. The world can be harsh but also beautiful and warm. It's a lovely fantasy grounded in reality, and perhaps that's why kids have loved it for so long -- they know when they're being told the truth.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Charlotte's Web","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=WwN4BgAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-0061124952","datePublished":"1952-10-15","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"E.B.

It has all the elements we've come to expect from a Vonnegut novel: biting satire, bizarre imagination, dry comedy, plus rich layering of commentary on philosophy, religion, humanity, and more. But this book adds an emotional depth, a wry warmth and kindness, and a fondness for his characters that is often lacking in his other works.\nVonnegut had a knack for sweetly melancholy humor, and he gives it free play here. Forget that it's science fiction, and forget the strange synopsis -- this story will draw you into a lovely and poignant rumination on the meaning of existence. If you were to cross Mark Twain in his bitter old age with Harper Lee you might get something like this -- biting humor and cynicism crossed with loving wisdom, delivered with the gentlest, most understanding, touch.

Children ages 8 to 10 who loved the first three books will find this one tougher going -- not just for its length but also for the convoluted plot, un-translated British vocabulary, and some horrific and deadly scenes that may concern parents.

As he is forced by the Dementors to confront his parents' deaths directly, Harry -- who was always so cool in the earlier books -- is more emotionally unstable. Unlike the static characters in other series, Harry is getting older, with all that entails.\nRowling is a master of careful plotting, and the author is rumored to have planned out the whole story of the series in advance, for a total of seven books.

It's completely wordless, and the pictures are a cross between scrapbook photos and storyboards for a silent movie. Done, incredibly, entirely in pencil and tinted in sepia tones, it's visually almost entirely metaphorical -- only the people, an array of nationalities and ethnicities, are recognizable. Everything else is designed to engender in the reader the same kind of awe and confusion that an immigrant might feel upon first arriving in a strange new country.\n&quot;The Arrival&quot; is aimed at older children and adults, and kids will need some help from parents if they're to get anything out of it. It assumes a high degree of visual literacy, as well as familiarity with the immigrant experience.

Start with a historical setting that opens up a new world to young readers, and tell the story in the voice of someone who lived it. Add intact families with strong, loving parents and wise, cantankerous elders, infuse it with incisive wit and humor, and spread it all out in some of the sharpest prose available in print today.\nThis is Mark Twain crossed with Dylan Thomas, and Peck is one of very few authors who could bear that comparison. This delightful little book is not for kids who need lots of action and adventure to keep them reading. But for those who can enjoy a warm and witty portrait of a time and place long gone but not yet forgotten, it's a true gem. And it might just send young readers scurrying for their own grandparents to hear more stories about their childhoods.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"On the Wings of Heroes","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=wicaxEFNeGMC","isbn":"978-0142412046","datePublished":"2007-02-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Richard Peck","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Richard_Peck_(writer)"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/7967-orig.jpg?itok=p0YepkgB"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Henry's Freedom Box","datePublished":"2008-01-18","description":"Inspirational in its simplicity, &quot;Henry's Freedom Box&quot; tells a moving story of one individual's strength of spirit.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/henrys-freedom-box","reviewBody":"Inspirational in its simplicity, &quot;Henry's Freedom Box&quot; tells a moving story of one individual's strength of spirit. It also poignantly presents the heart-wrenching sorrow of families torn apart, and the powerlessness of the enslaved. This book does not preach. In fact, its message is almost understated. But, in the eyes of the boy, the gentleness of his mother, the cramped crated body of the escaping man, its meaning comes across loud and clear: Even in the best of situations, slavery is an evil thing.\nArtwork by Kadir Nelson brings warmth and reality to a story that otherwise is told rather straightforwardly. With crosshatched pencil lines under layers of watercolor and oils, he has created amazingly sensitive and powerful portraits based on an anti-slavery lithograph of Henry \"Box\" Brown that was printed in 1850. His illustrations alone make this a book worth having.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Patricia Tauzer","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/patricia-tauzer"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Henry's Freedom Box","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=vnnCMgEACAAJ","isbn":"978-0439777339","datePublished":"2008-01-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ellen Levine","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/12930.Ellen_Levine"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/8023-orig.jpg?itok=J8k_Lql1"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"No Talking","datePublished":"2008-01-06","description":"OK, let's just state it baldly: Author Andrew Clements is a genius.

Painted in what might be called a graphic style, some scenes focus on the musicians themselves, who with eyes closed, seem to be playing or singing from the soul. Others show an audience whose members are jumping, jiving, and otherwise pulled into the captivating music that flows around them like \"a river of melody sketched in dim light.\" Everyone is having a good time, and the reader will, too.

But Book 7 in the saga of the Boy Who Lived will not disappoint. Author J. K. Rowling has lost none of her magic touch. Though there is, at times, a bit too much exposition, it's enthralling, exciting, suspenseful, surprising, clever, and moving from beginning to end. But there's one thing it isn't -- fun. You can't say she didn't warn us, however, as Rowling has publicly stated that fighting pure evil involves hardship, sacrifice, and death. The best word to describe this final book is grim.\nRowling retains her crown as the queen of plotting and pacing. Never for children, and rarely for adults, has there been an epic story arc this complex, convoluted, and carefully constructed. This final book makes it clear that there was hardly a wasted word or event in the whole series as everything comes together in a way that's satisfying -- and that rewards close reading of the previous books.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/136251.Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows","isbn":"9781338299205","datePublished":"2007-07-21","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"J.

Readers of all ages will find poems to fit any season, occasion, or mood and, even with repeated readings, will find something new and exciting to enjoy within its pages. The book is divided into 14 broad themes. An original poem by Jack Prelutsky, the first Poet Laureate for Children, introduces each thematic section, and each section is chockfull of works ranging from nursery rhymes to poems by William Shakespeare and Dr. Seuss. Familiar, traditional poems mingle with the fresh and unknown, the serious poems with the silly, and the old voices with new. The mix is engaging.\nTo add even more fun to these pages of poetry, illustrator Arnold Lobel brought his Caldecott Award-winning touch. His over 400 drawings and paintings make poetry all the more friendly and accessible to kids. Book-reading dinosaurs, plump smiling toads, and chubby-cheeked children are guaranteed to captivate even the most reluctant readers. The fun of poetry comes through here, and that was Prelutsky's aim when, in 1983, he first filled this book with poems he felt kids would like. Happily, he succeeded. And, 25 years later it has become a classic. Without a doubt, it will become one of the most dog-eared volumes on your bookshelf.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Patricia Tauzer","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/patricia-tauzer"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Random House Book of Poetry for Children","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/36944.The_Random_House_Book_of_Poetry_for_Children","isbn":"978-0394850108","datePublished":"1983-09-12","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jack Prelutsky","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/20775.Jack_Prelutsky"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/8293-orig.jpg?itok=zC9L-vyD"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Girl in the Castle Inside the Museum","datePublished":"2008-02-14","description":"&quot;The Girl in the Castle Inside the Museum&quot; is a layered story that weaves in and out, up and down, to form a fascinating fantasy.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-girl-in-the-castle-inside-the-museum","reviewBody":"&quot;The Girl in the Castle Inside the Museum&quot; is a layered story that weaves in and out, up and down, to form a fascinating fantasy. The haunting scene of a wispy, wistful girl peering into the glass case on the cover starts the journey. Inside the case, the girl in the castle, lonely in her turret, appears to be lost in a dreamlike trance. Yet as the story unfolds, the reader learns that the girl in the castle misses the children when they leave the museum, and dreams of their return. She even dreams of the reader, who is, in the end, invited to leave his\/her picture above the girl's bed inside the castle, inside the glass case, inside the museum, inside the book that the reader is holding.\nMuch like the Escher-like stairways of the illustrations, the three worlds intersect and blend into an unexpected story. And, with characters that look like dolls, dolls that look like porcelain figures from a Dali painting, strange toys, and hazy dream-like colors sparked here and there with a magical light, Kate Bernheimer and Nicoletta Ceccoli have created a mesmerizing fantasy world that is both uniquely surreal, yet comfortingly real and loving.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Patricia Tauzer","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/patricia-tauzer"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Girl in the Castle Inside the Museum","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/2114603.The_Girl_in_the_Castle_Inside_the_Museum","isbn":"978-0375836060","datePublished":"2008-02-12","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kate Bernheimer","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/70885.Kate_Bernheimer"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/8142-orig.jpg?itok=cly_rAYb"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Looking Glass Wars, Book 1","datePublished":"2006-10-07","description":"A sea-change is happening in children's book publishing, taking nearly a decade to come to its logical culmination in this book.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-looking-glass-wars-book-1","reviewBody":"A sea-change is happening in children's book publishing, taking nearly a decade to come to its logical culmination in this book. Written by a movie producer, plotted and paced like a movie, and promoted like one too, THE LOOKING GLASS WARS is a book designed for one thing -- to grab kids by the seat of the pants and keep them excitedly turning the pages. It accomplishes its goal with verve and imagination.\nAlice in Wonderland purists shouldn't even open the book -- this isn't for them. The Wonderland depicted here is both more horrific and more exciting than the surreal place Carroll imagined. Filled with monsters, magic, and a mixture of technologies, it's at once more fantastic and more grounded in the reality of war and totalitarian repression than its predecessor. Though The Looking Glass Wars is filled with topics for discussion (from literature to politics, history, and biography) and includes many parallels to events in today's world, this story is essentially fun -- well-written, well-constructed, lovingly thought-out and produced fun. It will do no harm at all to Carroll's classic -- which has always held more appeal for adults than children anyway -- and may interest a new generation of readers in the original.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Looking Glass Wars, Book 1","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=F5BnUBruvGsC","isbn":"978-0803731530","datePublished":"2006-09-26","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Frank Beddor","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frank_Beddor"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/5599-orig.jpg?itok=JH-X2xCg"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Song and Dance Man","datePublished":"2007-10-10","description":"It's hard not to be nostalgic about the good old days when reading &quot;Song and Dance Man&quot;, whether you were lucky enough to be around then or not.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/song-and-dance-man","reviewBody":"It's hard not to be nostalgic about the good old days when reading &quot;Song and Dance Man&quot;, whether you were lucky enough to be around then or not.

In her, both author and illustrator create the kind of independent, confident spirit that we hope all kids will discover in themselves.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Patricia Tauzer","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/patricia-tauzer"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Velma Gratch & the Way Cool Butterfly","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/2139851.Velma_Gratch_and_the_Way_Cool_Butterfly","isbn":"978-0307978042","datePublished":"2007-10-09","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alan Madison","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/261982.Alan_Madison"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/7948-orig.jpg?itok=ElNx2VzR"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Rabbit and the Turtle","datePublished":"2008-06-10","description":"Bright colors and cleverly detailed collages bring the fables alive, and anyone familiar with the work of Eric Carle will recognize his artwork at once.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-rabbit-and-the-turtle","reviewBody":"Bright colors and cleverly detailed collages bring the fables alive, and anyone familiar with the work of Eric Carle will recognize his artwork at once. \nAesop's fables have been around for centuries, and most readers have heard various versions of them all, especially the one about the turtle racing the hare. By choosing it as the title of his book, and changing it to &quot;The Rabbit and the Turtle&quot;, Eric Carle welcomes the reader into his collection and gives it a comfortably modern tone that echoes throughout the book, not only in the storytelling but in the vivid tissue paper collages that fill the pages.\nAs in the original version, each story is told in a single page, with a moral tagging along at the end. The language is the language of a storyteller, sophisticated enough to be dramatic and charming, yet easy enough to keep any reader interested. With his signature cut-and-layered hand-painted tissue paper, he has created colorfully intriguing scenes that fill the page opposite each story, capturing the essence of the fable. Each one is a joy to look at as the listener lets the lesson of each tale sink in.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Patricia Tauzer","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/patricia-tauzer"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Rabbit and the Turtle","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/2803217-the-rabbit-and-the-turtle","isbn":"978-0545005418","datePublished":"2008-06-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Eric Carle","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eric_Carle"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/8760-orig.jpg?itok=w8zuEzjf"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"There Is a Bird on Your Head!","datePublished":"2008-05-12","description":"The language is simple and repetitive enough for beginning readers to enjoy.

The theme that runs throughout &quot;Little House in the Big Woods&quot; is that life is hard and serious work, but that it's OK to have fun at times and important to keep a twinkle in your eye. There's much about young Laura's life that readers will find foreign: that children should be seen and not heard, that one small rag doll is the best Christmas gift ever, that hot potatoes in pockets and irons from the fire are the way to be warm when heading home from your cousins' house.\nThis installment is gentler than the rest of the Little House books, and the sexist and racist ideas that pop up throughout the series are mostly absent here. Children do get whipped twice, and there's a huge emphasis on children being obedient, but in Little House, it's wrapped in kindness.

They also will understand her dismay and unhappiness when the day doesn't turn out as she expected, and why she cannot sleep at night until the case of mistaken identity is solved. While parents may be amazed when her dad gets up at 2:30 in the morning to make things right, kids will agree with Trixie that he had found the perfect, and only, solution.\nOnce again, Mo Willems has created a masterpiece that will engage kids and parents alike. He has set simply drawn, yet colorful and expressive, cartoon characters against real black-and-white photographs of Brooklyn. The effect is captivating! The simple changes in facial expressions and body language create the drama, which is both humorous and touching. The photographic background provides detail and a true sense of place. On top of that, the language is straightforward and somewhat understated, which completes this perfect package.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Patricia Tauzer","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/patricia-tauzer"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Knuffle Bunny Too: A Case of Mistaken Identity","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/515905.Knuffle_Bunny_Too","isbn":"978-1423102991","datePublished":"2007-09-04","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mo Willems","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mo_Willems"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/knuffle-bunny-too.jpg?itok=UQZpCGDV"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Tico and the Golden Wings","datePublished":"2007-10-27","description":"&quot;Tico and the Golden Wings&quot;, like the many other remarkable fables by Leo Lionni, is a book to enjoy and savor both for its artwork and its story.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/tico-and-the-golden-wings","reviewBody":"&quot;Tico and the Golden Wings&quot;, like the many other remarkable fables by Leo Lionni, is a book to enjoy and savor both for its artwork and its story.

Just as the Caldecott Award went to The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, a work that blended graphic novel and prose to create the most original novel of the year, so the Newbery Award was given to GOOD MASTERS! SWEET LADIES!, a unique and vivid work that blends fiction, nonfiction, and drama to create something entirely new.\nEverything works beautifully here. The styles and voices of the characters vary according to their personalities, the author's own voice is warm and direct, and the illustrations and page design make this an attractive and accessible volume. Lots of information is given, but it is never dry or academic -- the format of monologues by fictional but realistic characters keeps it lively and engrossing. The book will appeal to many kids, including those who don't usually choose nonfiction, and will be useful for history classes and drama productions and workshops. Even reluctant readers will enjoy the clear, direct text, short length, and dramatic content. We can even hope that this brilliant book, with its awards and attendant success, may lead to a renaissance of books for kids that make history come alive.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Good Masters!

His artwork alone brings an amazing depth to this classic tale, which in his telling goes beyond the expected. He brings a multicultural sensitivity to a story that has long been part of a European tradition. And his language is poetic and captivating.\nWith pencil, watercolor, gouache, and ink on paper, Pinkney has filled each page with a scene that is expressive, delicate, strong, colorful, realistic, and imaginative all at the same time. The soft features of Little Red, her mother, and grandmother glow with sincerity. The woods silently filled with snow-covered birch and fir as well as creatures that seem ever-watchful help build a definite tension. The very realistic wolf almost seems to smile, though something in his face subtly says he is up to no good. And this is just the artwork: The language itself takes the traditional and makes it more. Poetic and pleasant, nothing is dumbed down here as modern retellings sometimes are. All senses are stimulated. Readers can smell the chicken soup simmering in the cozy kitchen, taste the snowflakes, hear the crunching of the snow and the chopping of the woodsman and feel the peaceful crisp cold of the forest. Of course, they have an amazing number of things to look at.

It's going to thrill teens even as it worries and disturbs some parents. Author Cory Doctorow combines his tech savvy (he is editor of Boing Boing and a former director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation), his political beliefs, and a frighteningly realistic extension of current trends to create a story that is not only impossible to put down, but is also one of those rare books that will change the way readers see the world.\nIt raises, in the most compelling way, issues of free speech, freedom vs. security, the rights of the government and the governed, and more. It's hard to think of another book that is so thought-provoking and at the same time such a page-turner. It should be discussed in every high school Civics and Government class -- but it probably won't be. Too bad it has that sex scene, which will mean many teachers will be unable to use it in class -- it would make an incredible discussion book.\nIt's that realism, both technical and political, that makes the book so exciting. Your teens are living in a brave new world, and few, if any, novels have captured that so vividly -- and few, if any, other authors have gotten the tech aspects so right: most who try just end up looking foolish. Unlike 1984, which inspired it, and most other future dystopian novels, it's all too easy to imagine the events of this book happening tomorrow. While Doctorow doesn't hedge at making his own position clear, and he makes a very convincing case, there is plenty of room for debate. But ultimately most readers will see things the author's way -- not, perhaps, just in the book, but in real life as well.\nThis is the kind of book that will have readers talking about it for days afterwards, that will make them see things in a new way, and that may inspire some of them to follow up on the clues and bibliography the author gives to learn more -- perhaps to some of their parents' chagrin.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Little Brother","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=r1zne2mZDW8C","isbn":"978-0765323118","datePublished":"2008-05-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Cory Doctorow","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cory_Doctorow"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/8880-orig.jpg?itok=t9rJNUvf"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Room One: A Mystery or Two","datePublished":"2008-08-18","description":"Andrew Clements violates just about every rule of story-writing, especially kid story writing, here -- and it works.

Ted, in particular, disproves all the old saws about good characters being dull -- he is absolutely mesmerizing, perhaps because his goodness is so modest, uncertain, and carefully considered and decided upon. Ted isn't just nice -- he chooses to do right after reflection, his character and principles are the result of determination, not accident, and he recognizes his mistakes and flaws.

Living with fear can make even the bravest person feel small ... a fear faced is a fear defeated.\" She has managed her own fears, she says, through art and doodling, and she welcomes Little Mouse, and the reader, to do the same on the pages of her book.\nConstructed much like a scrapbook or journal, the artistry of this book is outstanding and cleverly detailed. Little Mouse, who looks more like a pet white rat, scampers across tea-stained pages filled with doodles, cards, photos, and news clippings. She carries a red pencil that gets shorter, more worn, and definitely chewed on as she moves nervously through the book, recording her own fears and adding her own doodles.

And many of them have tried to express that love of books in their own work (see Other Choices below for some good examples). Often this leads them down the path of the grandly fantastic, in which people magically enter the books they are reading. Rarely has it worked the other way, where characters from their books enter their own lives. And almost never in the small, subtle ways they do here. This is an author who doesn't think you have to call in the big special effects to dramatize the wonder of books -- they do it all by themselves, in the myriad ways they move and change us.\n\tIn this unusual novel, reading and talking about books and thinking about them and going to the library are the adventures. It begins when Travis steps out of his new house in the planned subdivision with identical houses, and realizes he's in Camazotz. If you don't get that reference, put down the computer right now and get yourself a copy of A Wrinkle in Time . It's not necessary to have read Steinbeck, or any of the many other books referenced in the story, to understand and enjoy this, but familiarity certainly enhances the pleasure. \n \nFrom the Book\nTravis looked at the stack of books on his desk. These were his new life, his real life. A Wrinkle in Time led him to the library. Which led him to Corral de Tierra, which led him to The Pastures of Heaven, which led him to The Long Valley. And these books led him to the other mysteries that surrounded him -- Gitano and the Watchers and &quot;Steinbeck's Ghost&quot; -- led him deeper into a world he never suspected.\n\tBooks could do that to you. When you read, the world really did change. He understood this now. You saw parts of the world you never knew existed.

Kathryn Latsky's writing presents this amazing story in a way that is both approachable and complete. Together, they celebrate not only Darwin's exploration of ideas about the world he saw, but also, as the author hopes in her dedication, \"children, whose boundless curiosity gives them a right to know their history on Earth.\"\nThe artwork is equally extraordinary. Done in several layers, each illustration truly captures the intrigue and mystery of the natural world. Trueman began each one with a sensitive ink and watercolor drawing, added to it first with gouache and colored pencil, then a layer of acrylic painting. Finally, after a bit more graphite and colored pencil, he added subtle touches of paper, string, weeds, wildflowers, and other collage elements he gathered in the world around him. Amazing!

First, perhaps, is her gentle touch with magic. Rarely, if ever, has magic been this emotionally fraught and moving. Mibs's little brother Samson may have come into his &quot;Savvy&quot; early -- he is overwhelmed by the emotions of others, spending most of his time hiding in closets and under tables, but his gentle touch can make anyone feel better. The storms caused by her older brother, Fish, are reflections of his emotions. Her mother's &quot;Savvy&quot; is to do everything perfectly, which is not anywhere near as good as it sounds.\n\tMibs's own strange &quot;Savvy&quot;, which won't be revealed here, is not at all what she thinks it is, and comes with a powerful emotional component of its own. But, like one of Fish's storms, all of the events and journeys and delightfully quirky characters and, indeed, the entire story, revolve around one central point -- Mibs's father, lying silently in the hospital. His condition, and its realistic resolution, brings to the reader some of the emotional resonance that Mibs finds in the world during her two-day odyssey to learn to understand her own &quot;Savvy&quot; and reach her father. And that's a journey that, one way or another, we all take.\n \nFrom the Book:\n\t\"It's Poppa,\" Momma said in a choked voice, as her perfect features stretched and pinched.\n\tA gust of wind burst from Fish's side of the table, blowing everyone's hair and sending our paper napkins flying pell-mell onto the floor. The air in the room grew warm and humid as though the house itself had broken out into a ripe, nervous sweat, and the many dusty, tightly lidded, empty-looking jars that lined the tops of all the cupboards rattled and clinked like a hundred toasting glasses. Outside it was already raining Fish rain -- drops hastened from a sprinkle to a downpour in seconds as Fish stared, wide-eyed and gaping like his namesake, holding back his fear but unable to scumble his &quot;Savvy&quot;.\n\t\"Momma?\" Rocket ventured. The air around him crackled with static, and his T-shirt clung to him like socks to towels straight from the dryer.

Everything is amped up here -- the action and violence, to be sure, but also the friendships and relationships, the ethical dilemmas, the scope, and even the delving into the more arcane corners of Greek mythology. And Percy, the delightfully humorous and self-deprecating teen protagonist, comes charging fully into his own as a true hero, one who's fully in command of his powers but is also caring, concerned about others (including his enemies sometimes), and willing to let others be heroes, too, even at his own expense.\nAmidst all the exciting action, with gigantic battles that ravage the United States and shake New York to its foundations, it's Percy's growth -- both heroically and personally and echoed by growth in many of the other characters (even the gods) -- that makes this book so tremendously satisfying for fans. Up until now, the books have been top-notch formula fiction. But with this concluding chapter, author Rick Riordan raises the whole series into that timeless realm of children's fantasy fiction that's likely to last well beyond its current popularity.\n\tFrom the Book:\n\tInside, a row of yellow turbines the size of grain silos churned and hummed. Pressure gauges and computer terminals lined the opposite wall. A telkhine was hunched over a console, but he was so involved with his work, he didn't notice us. He was about five feet tall, with slick black seal fur and stubby little feet. He had the head of a Doberman, but his clawed hands were almost human. He growled and muttered as he tapped on his keyboard. Maybe he was messaging his friends on uglyface.com.\nI stepped forward, and he tensed, probably smelling something was wrong. He leaped sideways toward a big red alarm button, but I blocked his path. He hissed and lunged at me, but one slice of Riptide, and he exploded into dust.\n\"One down,\" Beckendorf said. \"About five thousand to go.\" He tossed me a jar of thick green liquid -- Greek fire, one of the most dangerous magical substances in the world. Then he threw me another essential tool of demigod heroes -- duct tape.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Last Olympian: Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 5","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=-UL-twAACAAJ","isbn":"978-1423101505","datePublished":"2009-05-05","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rick Riordan","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rick_Riordan"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/last-olympian.jpg?itok=ZfpHAUSG"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"King of the Screwups","datePublished":"2009-06-18","description":"This is a hilarious, and ultimately devastating, portrait of a kid who has been emotionally and verbally abused (along with his mother).","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/king-of-the-screwups","reviewBody":"This is a hilarious, and ultimately devastating, portrait of a kid who has been emotionally and verbally abused (along with his mother). We've all known kids like Liam -- bright, creative, talented, lovable -- who have fallen under the sway of someone who has convinced them that they're worthless, and they can't seem to see themselves through anyone else's eyes. Readers will be on Liam's side from the start. Even though the story is told in Liam's voice, readers will cotton on pretty quickly to the reality that Liam can't see and, so compelling is the author's way of telling the story, they will want to set him straight. But doing so is not so easy.\n\tWith italicized flashbacks to pivotal moments in Liam's life, readers get to see him both inside and out, past and present. Even though he is popular in both his old and new schools, the author induces a powerful feeling of empathy for him, something unusual in young adult books, in which popularity almost always equates with mean and shallow. Equally unusual is straight Liam's fashion sense, so perfectly presented that it may have even boys taking a closer look at their wardrobes, and his gay uncle and friends, none of whom fit into a stereotype -- or anti-stereotype. Liam's father is a bit one-dimensional, but since it is Liam telling the story, that makes some sense. All of the other characters are fully-realized, realistic, and delightful. And though it is often laugh-out-loud funny, this is a book that packs an emotional wallop, and one that is fairly earned.\n\tFrom the Book:\n\t\"My dad,\" I say defiantly. \"Because even though I don't look like him and I'm not smart like him, he's still my dad.\"\n\tFor a single second my father's chest swells. His eyes go from hard to soft. But then, before I have time to savor the moment, I screw up. And it's not just any screwup. It's the mother of all screwups.\n\t\"I know,\" I tell the interviewer on national TV, \"because they got the paternally test and everything. I heard Mom say it to my nana.

This book has frequently been compared with The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, though the similarities are superficial: a high-functioning autistic teen narrator and a mystery. Here the mystery isn't very mysterious -- the reader, and very soon after, Marcelo, have a pretty good idea what happened. The question is what Marcelo will do about it. It is watching Marcelo, with his unusual way of thinking and perceiving, feel his way to a decision and the consequences it will entail that provides the story. And it is seeing Marcelo grow in offbeat understanding of a kind seldom imparted to those with an ordinary view of the world that provides the heart.\n\tIn the course of this summer Marcelo faces, thinks about, and discusses with other characters many issues that will fascinate readers as well, from relationships and sex to ethics, human nature, and some unusually deep conversations about religion. The author is at some pains to make clear that Marcelo's condition is not precisely autism or Asperger's Syndrome, but something related, and really it is more of a literary tool to allow the author to look at the ordinary world through extraordinary eyes. This book will have readers taking a look at their own realities with perhaps a different point of view, and wondering if some aspects of Marcelo's so-called disability might actually be -- enviable.\n\tFrom the Book:\n\t\"It is an experience you haven't had, really. At Paterson you are in a protected environment. The kids who go there are not ... normal. Most of them will be the way they are all their lives. You, on the other hand, have the ability to grow and adapt. Even your Dr. Malone thinks this is the case. He's said so since the very first time we saw him. All these years, it wasn't really necessary for you to go to Paterson. You don't really belong there. I know you realize this yourself. There is nothing wrong with you. You just move at a different speed than other kids your age. But in order for you to grow and not get stuck, you need to be in a normal environment. It is time.

It is not for the faint of heart, but fans of Laurie Halse Anderson may find it hard to resist. Teens will find it depressing -- parents will find it even more so -- but Anderson's beautiful and evocative writing will compel them to read to the end. Anderson says in an afterward that she wrote this book because of so many readers who asked her to write about eating disorders, cutting, and feeling lost. It's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job.\nAn innovative style of journal writing is used to further illustrate a troubled mind -- some pages are blank while others feature crossed out words. Lia references fairy tales and fairy tale images that will appeal especially to female readers. This story has more brutality than a fairy tale from the Grimm brothers.  As Lia says, there is no magic cure for girls like her, but there is a tiny, potent thimbleful of hope in the end.\n ","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Debra Bogart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/debra-bogart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Wintergirls","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=56cJN2Pc3GAC","isbn":"978-0142415573","datePublished":"2009-03-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Laurie Halse Anderson","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Laurie_Halse_Anderson"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/wintergirls.jpg?itok=dRiafnYt"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"A Season of Gifts","datePublished":"2010-01-03","description":"Richard Peck has had one of the longest and most successful careers in children's literature and, reading this, it's easy to see why.

He just gets better and better. &quot;A Season of Gifts&quot; shows clearly that there's really no one else with Peck's remarkable combination of gifts. He has the gift of Twain, a humorist whose comedy is both intelligent and moving. He has the gift of Kipling, a craftsman of razor-sharp prose in which every word is carefully chosen for maximum effect. And he has the gift of Rowling, a constructor of intricate and tightly woven plots.\n\tPeck employs his remarkable gifts in the service of a character unique in children's books, a field in which children are almost always the heroes. Here the main character, moving force, and heroine is a crabby 90-year-old, tough as a goat, with nothing warm or fuzzy in her demeanor at all. In Peck's world, adults are still in charge and wiser than children, and children grow through their relationships with intelligent and caring grown-ups. Imagine that! This is a treasure and a delight.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"A Season of Gifts","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/6469790-a-season-of-gifts","isbn":"978-0142417294","datePublished":"2009-09-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Richard Peck","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Richard_Peck_(writer)"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/season.jpg?itok=FGTsOkPn"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Day-Glo Brothers","datePublished":"2010-01-14","description":"First-time author Chris Barton blends well-informed biography, history, and science into a delightful story that will delight curious kids, young artists, and budding scientists.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-day-glo-brothers","reviewBody":"First-time author Chris Barton blends well-informed biography, history, and science into a delightful story that will delight curious kids, young artists, and budding scientists.

Be sure to have a notebook and plenty of markers nearby -- your child probably will be fired up to start writing!\nSweet, colorful illustrations share space with Nancy\u2019s own artwork, including her very own poetry anthology.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Darienne Stewart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/darienne-stewart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Fancy Nancy: Poet Extraordinaire!","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/6948113-fancy-nancy","isbn":"978-0061896439","datePublished":"2010-03-02","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jane O'Connor","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/94085.Jane_O_Connor"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/fancynancy.jpg?itok=L3PLQ0uG"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Secret Science Alliance and the Copycat Crook","datePublished":"2010-04-15","description":"Writer and illustrator Eleanor Davis brings science and inventions to life with this funny comic book that celebrates smarts and shows that friends can be found in all walks of life.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-secret-science-alliance-and-the-copycat-crook","reviewBody":"Writer and illustrator Eleanor Davis brings science and inventions to life with this funny comic book that celebrates smarts and shows that friends can be found in all walks of life.

As in If I Stay, the author effectively intersperses the present with flashbacks that fill in the gaps of the three-and-a-half years since Mia's accident. It's satisfying to get Adam's perspective on the difficult months after Mia wakes up to discover she's entirely orphaned, and also hear him relate the earlier days of his relationship with Mia  -- including how wonderful the Hall family was to Adam, who always felt part of the clan. His feelings are understandably raw throughout the book, and he expresses them well in the lyrics of fictional album Collateral Damage. Forman beautifully describes the heartache Adam faces when seeing Mia again, and how it feels having to be pleasant and overly formal with someone you want to either kiss or hurt. \nThe story's one-long-night-together format is somewhat reminiscent of the classic romantic film Before Sunrise, except instead of young strangers on a train who quickly fall in love, this book's focus is in on a young couple that never stopped being in love -- but also has no idea how to move past the damage they've endured.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Where She Went","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=_BvBFO0xloQC","isbn":"978-0142420898","datePublished":"2011-04-05","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Gayle Forman","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gayle_Forman"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/whereshewent.jpg?itok=QG9GKV9q"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"You're Finally Here","datePublished":"2011-03-29","description":"Readers will fall in love with the cute bunny, whose eyebrows leap off his face when he's excited to see you and whose ears droop when the arrow on his bored-o-meter points to \"Bored Up To My Ears.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/youre-finally-here","reviewBody":"Readers will fall in love with the cute bunny, whose eyebrows leap off his face when he's excited to see you and whose ears droop when the arrow on his bored-o-meter points to \"Bored Up To My Ears.\" There are some great visual gags, such as the bunny standing up from a bench marked \"wet paint\" with khaki stripes across his back.

Though the little girl can act as one or the other, she is more often both at the same time. And there is really no rhyme or reason to why she swings back and forth. Kids, parents, and grandparents, will chuckle in recognition as they turn from page to page. As in The Hello, Goodbye Window, Chris Raschka's illustrations capture Juster's story perfectly, his colors and strokes changing subtly as the little girl's mood changes. While Sweetie Pie -- with her perky hair, eyes, and mouth -- she is awash in splashes of sunshiny bright colors. Sourpuss is much darker, a mouth turned down, eye's scrunched up, an angry body bathed in darker red, blues, browns, and grays.\nAnd this is not a book just for kids. Readers young and old will be captivated and engaged not only by the artwork but by both the language and the message it carries. Most will find themselves muttering Wow! How many times have I heard (or said) that before?

Though she is captured several times, and almost forced to marry first a toad then a mole, she manages to escape those fates and find a world where she fits in...and she marries the prince.  All of this happens because she is kind and good, and sensible. She is strong enough to survive for a while in the woods, and has feelings of loyalty for those who help her.   \nThe story is a good one, and told as Hans Christian Andersen meant it to be told. In fact, Sylvia Long's version follows the classical text fairly closely, and is\namong the most beautifully illustrated. Her gorgeous\nwatercolors will absolutely take your breath away.  The many available musical, film, and written versions of Thumbelina span the gamut, from the classical tale with its Arthur Rackman illustrations to Disney and Barbie versions with bright, cartoonish illustrations and simplified storytelling. Versions readers, and art lovers, might also appreciate are those by Susan Jeffers, Brian Pinkney, and Brad Sneed.  \nThe artwork in this version of Thumbelina is among the best ever.  Pages overflow with flowers, butterflies, birds, and a magic that is both sensual and realistic. Dragonflies, goldfish, and the tiny den of the field mouse are particularly amazing.  And the final 3-panelled layout showing small people cupped in a garden of flowers is exquisite! Even without the words of Hans Christian Andersen, Sylvia Long's breath-taking watercolors create a stunning fairy world\nsure to evoke the imaginations of readers of all ages.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Patricia Tauzer","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/patricia-tauzer"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Sylvia Long's Thumbelina","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=UZgcAAAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-0811855228","datePublished":"2010-02-24","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sylvia Long","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/37234.Sylvia_Long"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/sylvia-longs-thumbelina.jpg?itok=KNJLxhC5"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Stone Soup","datePublished":"2013-05-02","description":"&quot;Stone Soup&quot; is a favorite with young kids, who enjoy the \"tricky\" aspect of the story as much as its important lesson.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/stone-soup","reviewBody":"&quot;Stone Soup&quot; is a favorite with young kids, who enjoy the \"tricky\" aspect of the story as much as its important lesson.

Then they turn to the laboratory: \"Don't worry. We can solve this with science!\" says one weasel. Sharp readers know the answer is simply plugging the machine's cord back into the wall. \nThe watercolor-and-ink illustrations are packed with fun details and deadpan observations such as, \"Without this drill I am nothing,\" as well as subtle pop culture allusions, as when the game \"World of Woodcraft\" is seen on a computer screen. There are also plenty of silly moments to entertain little ones, such as a weasel accidentally spilling coffee on the head of his coworker.

There's as much to notice in the art as there is in the young boy's walk, and visual themes are threaded through; the promise of the rainbow is hinted at when the boy points to a rainbow ice pop.\nThis is a book for parents and kids to share and treasure, a reminder to stop and enjoy not only the world but the young children in our care.

Neither the term \"sexual predator\" nor \"sexual harassment\" appear in the text. \"Master manipulator\" and \"harassment\" do. &quot;Chirp&quot; author Kate Messner boldly handles the challenge of tackling this sensitive subject and balancing the narrative threads.\nKids will love sleuthing with the girls and the excitement of munching on crickets while trying to sell a business idea to attentive entrepreneurs.

Nearly all of the moms and adult women surrounding these girls have a #MeToo story to share. &quot;Chirp&quot; has moments of true cinematic finesse, such as Mia's frustration with the female crickets who are silent while the males make a deafening racket.

Author Linda Sue Park doesn't gloss over the gory details -- a child is eaten by a lion, and Salva watches his uncle get shot to death -- but she doesn't dwell on them, either, making this book an appropriate choice for tweens. Some of the saddest moments come when Salva remembers the family he's separated from, including his father, who would sometimes ride home on his bicycle with mangoes wedged in his spokes.

Kids will have fun spotting those beloved characters.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Regan McMahon","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/regan-mcmahon"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Dr. Seuss's Horse Museum","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/44492290-dr-seuss-s-horse-museum?from_search=true","isbn":"978-0399559129","datePublished":"2019-09-03","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dr. Seuss","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dr._Seuss"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/dr-seusss-horse-museum-book-cover-image-resized.jpg?itok=YGXAolcb"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Foxheart","datePublished":"2016-12-01","description":"Claire Legrand's tour de force delivers a magical misfit heroine and a heart-stealing dog in a riveting cosmic conflict, with much devastating loss and joyous triumph along the way.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/foxheart","reviewBody":"Claire Legrand's tour de force delivers a magical misfit heroine and a heart-stealing dog in a riveting cosmic conflict, with much devastating loss and joyous triumph along the way. &quot;Foxheart&quot; brings a lot of positive messages as its imaginative plot unfurls, and raises a lot of relatable themes, from fledgling friendship gone wrong to abandonment issues.

Henry \"walked into the dark jaws of the forest,\" where she sees \"a wraith of smoke,\" and where \"the sunlit leaves trembled with secrets.\" This family has secrets, as does the house they move into, and the woods surrounding it, and readers are held rapt as author Lucy Strange uncovers them bit by bit.\nStrange weaves in references to classic books, seamlessly connecting them to the plot without losing momentum. And because the book's set in 1919, it has some charming period details (Lucy wears pinafores), making it feel like one of the classics itself. The stakes are high as Henry fights the doctor to keep her mom and baby sister, though the doctor can sometimes seem a bit villain-like. And the drugs he prescribes add an extra edge, given the current opioid crisis in the United States. The themes of grief and mental instability can feel dark for the age group, but as Henry takes brave steps to save herself and her family, we're absorbed in the drama and moved by her plight.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Secret of Nightingale Wood","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=1338157493","isbn":"9781338312850","datePublished":"2017-10-31","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lucy Strange","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/15300765.Lucy_Strange?from_search=true"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/51kh6ooyifl-sx329-bo1204203200.jpg?itok=j0N_kdSF"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Glimmer of Hope: How Tragedy Sparked a Movement","datePublished":"2018-11-05","description":"This is the inspiring story of how a small group of teens refused to give into grief and anger and instead took action, organizing a march against gun violence.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/glimmer-of-hope-how-tragedy-sparked-a-movement","reviewBody":"This is the inspiring story of how a small group of teens refused to give into grief and anger and instead took action, organizing a march against gun violence.

In &quot;Good Enough&quot;, author Jen Petro-Roy, an eating disorder survivor, gets deep into the hard emotional work it takes to get better and does it in a way that will resonate with middle-grade and younger readers. Many other YA novels about eating disorders focus on older teens and understandably have more adult content as a result, so &quot;Good Enough&quot; hits a much-needed sweet spot with its focus on 12-year-old Riley and the issues she faces as she's entering her teen years.\nThe story is told through her journal entries. In the early chapters, her sarcastic defensiveness starts to wear thin, but as she works through recovery she grows and her insights are wonderful to follow. The book hits on many important points, including showing how hard recovery is and that living life after recovery can be even harder; how well meaning parents can still mess up a kid; and the power others' words can have on the psyche. The latter isn't unusual in the middle school years, but verbal bullying and casual cruelty can have lasting effects, and the story shows this to great effect. The best part of &quot;Good Enough&quot; and its journal format is the insight it gives into the brain of anorexics, especially the negative self-talk and the desire for control over this one aspect of their lives. The only downside to the journal format is that the other characters -- parents, sibling, friends, staff -- don't quite come alive, but that is a small point in an overall educational and entertaining read.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Cosola","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mary-cosola"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Good Enough","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/about\/Good_Enough_A_Novel.html?id=cPtwDwAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-1250123510","datePublished":"2019-02-19","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jen Petro-Roy","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/15136596.Jen_Petro_Roy"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/good-enough-cover-opt.png?itok=AEgoS1M3"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"I'm Just No Good at Rhyming: And Other Nonsense for Mischievous Kids and Immature Grown-Ups","datePublished":"2017-10-21","description":"This highly imaginative book of poems uses a whole arsenal of clever tricks to get kids to giggle while challenging them to think.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/im-just-no-good-at-rhyming-and-other-nonsense-for-mischievous-kids-and-immature-grown","reviewBody":"This highly imaginative book of poems uses a whole arsenal of clever tricks to get kids to giggle while challenging them to think. The wordplay in I'm Just No Good at Rhyming sensitizes kids to language. Is breakfast chocolate choco-late or choco-early?

Sometimes author Chris Harris goes meta, as when illustrator Lane Smith comments, \"Sorry, Chris, I have to stop you right there. This poem is too ridiculous.\" There are also running gags: poems that riff on previous poems. And in a really rogue move, Harris messes with the page numbers, eliminating all eights, which he combines with a poem about a kid who wasn't taught the number eight. He apologizes for putting that kid's parents in charge of pagination.\nThere are some unusual and surprising rhymes: \"tomato\/not today though,\" \"grateful\/irateful.\" Mostly, the rhymes trip off the tongue, but there's the occasional near-rhyme misstep: \"fierce\/years\"? And in one poem, Harris leaves his kid-friendly POV to deliver a slightly sour lesson from a parent.

The book was a huge hit as soon as it was published in 1900 and was followed by more than a dozen sequels.\nThere are many editions available of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, but the original was very much a team effort of author Baum and illustator W.W.

There are heroes and monsters on both sides, and Jeffrey is able to find, even in the most hate-filled among them, redeeming qualities and humanity.\nBut though Jeffrey makes a difference in the lives of many, the reader is forced to realize that the idea that he can somehow bring about a reconciliation between the races is naive.

When Roz leaves the farm, embarking on her long journey, there are danger and chase scenes, but also friendly animals who come to Roz's aid, as they might in a fairy tale.

Jack is a foster kid who's had a rough time in the foster care system. His best friend, Quint, is full of quirks, Dirk is the school bully, and June rarely admits she needs help.\nThe Jack-June portrayal gets better over time, but in the beginning, Jack treats her like something to be won (\u201cI call dibs on her\u201d) and doesn\u2019t listed when she tells him to go away. She sets a boundary and he blows right past it -- hardly the example to show readers navigating their own crushes.

Combine her poetic writing style with the complicated plot line of a four-book series, and it's easy to imagine that some readers won't get past the first 50 pages. That's a shame for impatient readers, because once you're fully immersed in the story, it has a glorious, meticulously planned payoff that will simultaneously break your heart, give you hope, and make you demand the next installment.\nAlthough Dream Thieves, as with all of Stiefvater's books, switches points of view among multiple characters, the main focus is the titular \"Dream Thief,\" Ronan Lynch, a troubled soul who can't get over the death of his father. Adam continues to struggle with a mountainous \"trailer trash\" chip on his shoulder (he's a genius but has no money, no family, and too much pride), but, like all of the Raven Boys, there's more to him, and you ache for him to find love. Blue and Gansey's friendship teeters dangerously on the verge of something more. And Mr. Gray is the most perfectly named, morally ambiguous new character to the already crowded story. Keep reading, because however big the fireworks are in Dream Thieves, it's clear this series is only going to keep getting better and better.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Dream Thieves: The Raven Cycle, Book 2","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/17347389-the-dream-thieves","isbn":"9780606360296","datePublished":"2013-09-17","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Maggie Stiefvater","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maggie_Stiefvater"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/dream-thieves-cover.jpg?itok=O3AMEc1d"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Emma","datePublished":"2012-10-28","description":"Funny and highly entertaining, &quot;Emma&quot; is full of romance, plot twists, and comic confusion.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/emma","reviewBody":"Funny and highly entertaining, &quot;Emma&quot; is full of romance, plot twists, and comic confusion.

Stiefvater has said that &quot;Sinner&quot; is the \"truest novel\" she's ever written, and that's because, except for the little fact that Cole is secretly a werewolf, &quot;Sinner&quot; reads more like a nuanced contemporary romance than a fantasy love story like her other books. Renowned for her passion for cars (which are lovingly described in each of her books) and driving metaphors, Stiefvater quite perfectly sets &quot;Sinner&quot; in Los Angeles, where everyone spends a good portion of his or her life behind the wheel. Cole's desire for his beloved old Mustang, Isabel's anger at her blinged-out SUV, and Cole's new good friend Leon, a limo driver, are only a few examples of the significant connection between characters and cars in the revved-up love story.\nFans of Sam and Grace should take heart: They are both mentioned in this novel, although their cameos aren't nearly as substantial as Etienne and Anna's in Stephanie Perkins' Lola and the Boy Next Door. Stiefvater clearly wants the spotlight to stay on Cole and Isabel's turbulent romance, not dwell on another couple's happily-ever-after. Cole and Isabel are far edgier than earnest Sam and Grace, so it's fitting that this story is an unputdownable ride you'll be sad to finish.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Sinner","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=Sl5fAgAAQBAJ","isbn":"9780545654593","datePublished":"2014-07-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Maggie Stiefvater","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maggie_Stiefvater"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/sinner.jpg?itok=e8hGeMf-"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Miles Morales: Spider-Man","datePublished":"2017-08-01","description":"Clever, timely, and fun, this fresh Spider-Man story explores the real-life implications of the school-to-prison pipeline and the prison industrial complex in a way that's easy for teens to grasp.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/miles-morales-spider-man","reviewBody":"Clever, timely, and fun, this fresh Spider-Man story explores the real-life implications of the school-to-prison pipeline and the prison industrial complex in a way that's easy for teens to grasp.

From the opening-page map to the familiar station names (Succotash Hut, Fudge Shoppe, Pie Palace, Kettle Corn Kettle) to the deliciously detailed snack foods (readers should know they will be hungry upon finishing), this is the sort of sweet-as-pie story that middle schoolers and moms alike will adore.\nAlthough the primary plotline revolves around Deja persuading Josiah to talk to Marcy, the Fudge Shoppe worker he's been smitten with for three years, the story goes far beyond that to explore the main characters' personalities, flaws, strengths, and experiences (he's cautious, she's impetuous; he's never been in a relationship, she's had several). The story also explores how bittersweet senior year is, this season walking a fine line between adolescence and adulthood when every big event is the \"last\" before everything changes. But along with the underlying substantive themes, there's a whole lot of fun. There's even a rowdy billy goat on the loose that the protagonists tend to ignore as they snack and make their way across the pumpkin patch. &quot;Pumpkinheads&quot; is sure to win over even the most jaded of readers.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Pumpkinheads","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/40864790-pumpkinheads","isbn":"9781626721623","datePublished":"2019-08-27","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rainbow Rowell","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rainbow_Rowell"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/pumpkinheads.jpg?itok=RsEbdceK"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Laura Dean Keeps Breaking Up with Me","datePublished":"2020-02-02","description":"Mariko Tamaki and Rosemary Valero-O'Connell's beautiful and emotional graphic novel thoughtfully explores friendship, love, toxic relationships, and self-worth.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/laura-dean-keeps-breaking-up-with-me","reviewBody":"Mariko Tamaki and Rosemary Valero-O'Connell's beautiful and emotional graphic novel thoughtfully explores friendship, love, toxic relationships, and self-worth.

Along the way, there's a lot of comical gore, and lots of opportunities to observe how fear distorts your perspective, and how things get weird fast if you misunderstand cultural differences.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Eisenhart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mary-eisenhart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Assassination of Brangwain Spurge","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/38526611-the-assassination-of-brangwain-spurge","isbn":"9781536213096","datePublished":"2018-09-25","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"M.T.

It's the kind of book that makes the reader sigh happily after finishing it, then turn back to the beginning and read it again, just for the pleasure of it. It's a book that thousands of music teachers all over the country will be given as a holiday present by grateful students, a book that may inspire both teachers and students to new ideas and new understandings of each other.

He and co-author and illustrator Victoria Jamieson manage this moving story with simple, often elegant words and with lively pictures that use bright and beautiful colors. It's almost impossible not to admire Omar's spirit and appreciate the lessons he learns about family, faith, community, hope, and perseverance.\nA flashback sequence when Omar tells how he and his brother lost their home and family, and about their long journey to the refugee camp, is scary and sad. Sadness from losing his parents is also mentioned a lot, so be prepared to help younger readers who connect to the story work through any fears that may come up. Everything has a safe resolution, and reading the Afterward and Author's Note will bring even more resolution to the story.

When Jackson describes how his family had to live out of their van for 14 weeks, the detail is vivid: They washed their clothes in rest-stop bathrooms; the family ate burned pancakes discarded by a diner. But Jackson's family is loving, if struggling, and readers will enjoy Jackson's take on the situation and get how disturbing it is for him to have to deal with a giant cat only he can see.\nAuthor Katherine Applegate is sensitive to the family's vulnerability as they're pushed to the economic edge because of health problems and layoffs.

Sales has a light touch with the life lessons, letting her protagonist figure things out for herself rather than jumping in with sermons. Sophisticated readers may roll their eyes a bit at how conveniently potentially plan-derailing issues work themselves out -- as when Lottie, determined to tag along on a classmate's trip to Italy on short notice, miraculously has a passport already (which, considering she's an undocumented time traveler, is a bit much). But the girls' struggles against insurmountable forces to stay connected will grab many a young reader, and book-loving kids will find Lottie especially relatable:\n\"Everyone in my family read during dinner, and pretty much all the rest of the time, too. I had A Little Princess in my lap, and as soon as Dad finished telling us about time travel, I was planning to read (for the eleventh time) the scene where Sara makes Miss Minchin cross by being secretly fluent in French. A Little Princess is my favorite book. I took it out of the library six times in a row before I had saved up enough pocket money to buy my own copy.\"","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Eisenhart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mary-eisenhart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Once Was a Time","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/25777460-once-was-a-time","isbn":"978-1452140094","datePublished":"2016-04-05","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Leila Sales","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/3390621.Leila_Sales"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/once-was-a-time-resized.jpg?itok=qk30mTpk"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Posted","datePublished":"2017-07-17","description":"Author John David Anderson offers words of comfort and hope in his insightful portrayal of middle school pressures -- to be liked yet to be yourself, while weighing the risk in every interaction.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/posted","reviewBody":"Author John David Anderson offers words of comfort and hope in his insightful portrayal of middle school pressures -- to be liked yet to be yourself, while weighing the risk in every interaction.

He exposes the casual cruelty of middle schoolers without flinching, but also shows how compassion and strength can still shine brightly.\nFrost is a strong narrator, sharing his affection for his quirky friends as well as his self-consciousness about his tribe, and his sometimes regrettable behavior when it comes to Rose.

Though some of the language in this 1883 novel can seem old-fashioned, and occasionally racist, there's plenty of suspense and swashbuckling battles to keep readers engaged. Equally appealing is the way the author develops characters and the relationship between Jim Hawkins and the one-legged Long John Silver.\nSilver is a complex character, with measured judgment and superior intelligence, and Stevenson's descriptions of his appearance and manner of speaking created the mold for just about every fictional pirate that came after him. Likewise, elements of the book -- including the treasure map marked with an \"X,\" the song \"Dead Man's Chest (Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Rum),\" and parrots -- show the way Stevenson invented the popular image of a pirate. This is an important book and a thrilling one. \n\t ","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Barbara Schultz","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/barbara-schultz"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Treasure Island","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=UPAYAAAAYAAJ","isbn":"9781684127955","datePublished":"1883-11-14","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Robert Louis Stevenson","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Robert_Louis_Stevenson"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/treasureisland.jpg?itok=wsNbKuLi"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Apprentices: The Apothecary, Book 2","datePublished":"2013-06-03","description":"Some Apothecary fans may be disappointed at the relatively brief (or sometimes non-) appearances of favorite secondary characters, but the current cast and their interactions are deftly handled.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-apprentices-the-apothecary-book-2","reviewBody":"Some Apothecary fans may be disappointed at the relatively brief (or sometimes non-) appearances of favorite secondary characters, but the current cast and their interactions are deftly handled. The Apprentices will make a lot more sense to those who've already read The Apothecary, as many characters (and their issues) return from that story. The fast-moving plot has characters whisked from one side of the world to the other as new, sinister villains threaten the world and our heroes; Ian Schoenherr's illustrations add vivid appeal. The story brings a wealth (which might border on overload if it weren't so intriguing) of anthropological field reports, mid-20th-century history and political issues, ethical dilemmas, and magic -- as well as the social difficulties of high school. A third volume is in the works to resolve some of the pending cliffhangers.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Eisenhart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mary-eisenhart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Apprentices: The Apothecary, Book 2","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=pvz5RrUH_aoC","isbn":"978-0399162459","datePublished":"2013-06-04","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Maile Meloy","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maile_Meloy"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/apprentices.jpg?itok=O45mCk7B"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Apothecary, Book 1","datePublished":"2011-10-04","description":"This is a great book -- well written, deft in its handling of themes and issues, and full of characters who are engaging even as we see their flaws.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-apothecary-book-1","reviewBody":"This is a great book -- well written, deft in its handling of themes and issues, and full of characters who are engaging even as we see their flaws.

Told from the perspectives of characters on opposite sites of the world, the plot moves along quickly as the heroes encounter colorful locals, dodge deadly perils, pursue magical knowledge, and learn a few life lessons while trying to avert nuclear destruction. Thanks to Meloy's skill as a writer, characters are intriguing individuals; normally implausible plot developments such as the Scotts' sudden writing job in Italy make perfect sense; and bits of incidental detail such as a song and a robin's-egg-blue dress conjure up the feeling of life in the '50s. Ian Schoenherr's plentiful illustrations bring the story to life with compelling detail and airborne adventure.\nThere's enough description of foregoing events that you won't be entirely lost if you start here, but you'll miss a lot.

Beginning with elements of the Theseus myth, she mixes in a large dollop of Battle Royale by Koushun Takami, elements of Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, reality TV shows Survivor, American Gladiators, and Project Runway, and an extrapolation of current political and social trends. But she makes it her own, and The Hunger Games avoids feeling derivative through her complex and poignant characterizations of both major and secondary characters, and the bewildering interplay of personal feelings and political machinations.\nCollins does all this in the context of an all-out action-thriller told in straight-ahead yet subtle prose with a carefully calibrated level of edgy violence that never goes over the line. A story of teens massacring one another could, in the hands of a different author, have been sensationalistic and even sick but, by keeping the focus relentlessly on the personal, Collins makes it both moving and thought-provoking. This will be a terrific discussion starter for middle-school literature groups, in which students will quickly make fruitful connections to our own society. Her novel Gregor the Overlander series is brilliant. With this second series, Collins shows that she's a major voice in children's and young adult literature.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Hunger Games, Book 1","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=_zSzAwAAQBAJ","isbn":"9781338321913","datePublished":"2008-09-14","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Suzanne Collins","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Suzanne_Collins"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/9450-orig.jpg?itok=praje2LU"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Wishing Spell: The Land of Stories, Book 1","datePublished":"2012-07-13","description":"There's a real, heartfelt warmth to this book's characters and their situations, as well as the strong sensibility of an adult who hasn't forgotten the joys and the terrors of childhood.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-wishing-spell-the-land-of-stories-book-1","reviewBody":"There's a real, heartfelt warmth to this book's characters and their situations, as well as the strong sensibility of an adult who hasn't forgotten the joys and the terrors of childhood.\nBooks that imagine fairy-tale characters outside the bounds of their own traditional stories are popular these days; The Hero's Guide to Saving Your Kingdom and Storybound come to mind.

Readers don't need to relate to her or even like her to feel invested in her story, which takes bizarre, heartbreaking, but always revelatory twists and turns. In Arnold's crisp prose, Mim comes alive in all her flawed glory. A loner whose best friend is her mysteriously absent mother, she would love to be played by Kate Winslet in the imaginary filmed version of her life, but she amends this choice to Zooey Deschanel before admitting that, OK, she's more of a young Ellen Page. She categorizes the kinds of suburban teens who act, dress, and think the same as the \"Generics,\" who don't treasure fierce individuality the way Mim does; in her letters, she's as beautifully damaged and in need of hope and friendship as Charlie in The Perks of Being a Wallflower or Laurel in Love Letters to the Dead.\nSo here's this puking, half-blind, unpredictable girl who hears voices in her head, and all she wants is to reach the one person in the world she knows loves her unconditionally. Along the way, she meets an older woman, Arlene, and two guys -- Walt, a homeless teenager with Down syndrome living under a bridge in Independence, Kentucky, and Beck, a gorgeous 20- or 21-year-old college guy who was on the bus with her -- who quickly become her close friends (and in the case of Beck, her unattainable love interest). They each make Mim reconsider the way she closes herself off to anyone other than her mother. This trip is anything but easy, and at times it's so hard and heavy you want to reach out and hug Mim (or slap her, or both), but there's hope, too -- a conversation you don't want to end, a chaste kiss full of promise, a new beginning after so many old hurts.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Mosquitoland","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=_t3bAwAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-0147513656","datePublished":"2015-03-03","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"David Arnold","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/7368938.David_Arnold"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/18718848.jpg?itok=krD9ZhwB"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"When Spring Comes","datePublished":"2016-03-23","description":"Spring is a teasing season, unfurling in fits and starts and testing our patience -- and that's part of its charm, as the talented husband-and-wife team of Kevin Henkes and Laura Dronzek point out.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/when-spring-comes","reviewBody":"Spring is a teasing season, unfurling in fits and starts and testing our patience -- and that's part of its charm, as the talented husband-and-wife team of Kevin Henkes and Laura Dronzek point out. &quot;When Spring Comes&quot; showcases Henkes' poetic eye for detail along with Dronzek's vibrant, gorgeous acrylic paintings.

The body language of the dad and boy clearly conveys the affection they share, and Bui's midnight blue night scenes evoke the early hour.

The front and back covers, showing Nick and Aleasha dancing together for sheer joy, sum up the spirit of this hilarious, subtly poignant story of family love. Easy to read but appealing to all ages, it is perfect for young readers and makes a surefire family read-aloud.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Matt Berman","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/matt-berman"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Puppy Sister","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/7612274-the-puppy-sister","isbn":"9781616239404","datePublished":"1995-01-01","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"S.

Esplin brings a riveting tale of kids on a deserted Nevada highway in the wake of a multiweek power outage that, as they sometimes note, could signal the zombie apocalypse. Thirteen-year-old John and his newfound friend Cleverly, a girl his age, grapple with the challenges of keeping themselves and their younger sibs alive as they endure blazing sun, hot asphalt, dust, wind, and no water. They meet some people who try to help them and others who'd gladly rob them and leave them to die. It's way more than kids their age should have to deal with, but it's not like they have a lot of choice. And the journey presents a lot of moments that test them, their values, and their character, even as it raises the nagging possibility that all that may not matter any more, at least to a lot of people.\n\"I know. I get it. People do crazy things when their own survival is at stake, things they never thought they'd do. Like rob kids at gunpoint. Or drink toilet water. Or commit grand theft auto.

It has all the necessary characteristics: suspense, kid appeal, plenty of emotion, and charismatic animal characters. Babe is the underdog -- er, underpig -- who, through sheer sincerity and genuineness, defies the odds in this heartwarming, farmyard equivalent of a rags-to-riches tale. It's an action-packed, universal story of unlikely friendships and even unlikelier triumphs, of forgiveness, determination, and the power that results from believing in oneself. Even the most disrespectful characters are ultimately reformed by Babe's positive example, providing a subtle yet effective lesson in virtuous behavior that won't be lost on readers of any age.\nPart of the book's immense charm comes from the portions of dialogue that reflect rural British speech. In addition to deciphering the richly authentic dialect, some young readers will need assistance defining terms such as daft and cultural references such as dialing 999 when an emergency occurs.

Kids born post-9\/11 might need to supplement the history. Baskin mentions the \"heroes\" on Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania, but doesn't say what they did or how the plane went down. And there's no mention of the war that resulted. The story is confined to the United States, which makes a cohesive, compelling read, and it makes the case that we're all part of one American family, though some will miss a broader international context, a suggestion that we're also part of a larger human global community.\nThe true value and strength of this book lies in its ability to get young readers thinking and talking about issues of tolerance.

The depth of research in &quot;My Brigadista Year&quot; is clear, but the book never reads like a weighty lecture. Award-winning author Katherine Paterson deftly opens a window onto this period and culture, involving us with Lora, who's bookish and shy with doubts and fears, but also determined and brave. And Paterson keeps the stakes high. When a gang of anti-revolutionary fighters threatens to kill the brigadistas, Lora's given the opportunity to return home, but weighs her options and chooses to stay, proving to be a strong female role model.\nThe values of the story are humanitarian. Lora's family struggled under Batista and is sympathetic to the socialist goals of the Cuban Revolution, and her uncle fought and died in an earlier uprising. In an epilogue, Lora acknowledges that Cuba is \"not perfect, but we do have an educated, literate population. We do have doctors.\" She also says she hopes that \"someone reading my story will better understand both me and the country I love.\" At a time when U.S.-Cuba relations are again in play, this book builds a bridge, inviting readers to view this impressive accomplishment of the Cuban Revolution -- helping a huge swath of citizens who were signing their names by thumbprint learn to read and write -- through the eyes of a brave, selfless, and very relatable young participant.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"My Brigadista Year","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0763695084","isbn":"9781536202236","datePublished":"2017-10-10","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Katherine Paterson","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Katherine_Paterson"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/51xiopdmhul-sx334-bo1204203200-1.jpg?itok=9M8Fp6mE"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Sawkill Girls","datePublished":"2018-10-23","description":"This spine-tingling and suspenseful page-turner is filled with dark family secrets, betrayals, supernatural twists and turns, and empowered teen heroines.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/sawkill-girls","reviewBody":"This spine-tingling and suspenseful page-turner is filled with dark family secrets, betrayals, supernatural twists and turns, and empowered teen heroines.

From the terror of a narrow midnight escape from the Taliban, and the tragic loss of the youngest child, to the final resolution of the story, the action moves through so many ups and downs, some of which are world events, others more personal. Along the way, pertinent facts about Afghanistan and the immigrant experience are mixed in. Readers will be drawn in by it all, especially by the characters of Fadi, his family, and friends. They are very human, yet amazingly honorable and thoughtful people.\nReaders of all ages will gain sensitive insight into the hardships immigrants experience in their daily lives, especially those seeking asylum from oppressive cultures. And, they will be reminded of how the 9\/11 terrorist attacks made the lives of Muslim immigrants even harder. But middle-grade readers, in particular, will relate to Fadi as an 11-year-old trying to fit in. Not only has he come from a very different world, carrying a terrible secret and guilt, but he also has the usual anxieties and difficulties of any \"new kid,\" and almost immediately he is the target of two school bullies. The hopeful message is that he finds solace and hope in his family and good friends as well as in his photography, and he makes honorable choices even in the most rugged situations. Though the characters, language, and even the plot are a bit stiff at times, that message alone makes this is a book everyone should read.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Patricia Tauzer","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/patricia-tauzer"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Shooting Kabul","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=XY2AAwAAQBAJ","isbn":"978-1442401952","datePublished":"2011-07-12","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"N.

Author Katherine Applegate often untangles thorny subjects for young readers, in the past addressing captive animals and homelessness. In &quot;Wishtree&quot;, she takes on anti-Muslim bigotry, handling the subject with a light touch, so the treatment doesn't feel heavy. There's sly humor, and fun friendships involving the tree, talking animals, and humans, mixed in with some meaty scientific information about trees and animals. Applegate, a lovely writer, sprinkles the story with language that's strikingly beautiful but never showy. For instance, a sky's described as \"freckled with stars,\" a crow\u2019s eyes are \"like morning blackberries, dark and dewy,\" and a night sky displays a \"splinter of moon.\"\nLike many beloved kids' novels, this one is enhanced with illustration, and readers will be charmed by the black-and-white drawings by Charles Santoso (Ida, Always) scattered throughout. If, like the tree, we're sometimes baffled by angry human behavior and ugly conflict, this story's a balm, promoting acceptance and empathy, and full of quiet wisdom and soothing pleasures.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Wishtree","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=1250143039","isbn":"978-1432848217","datePublished":"2017-09-26","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Katherine Applegate","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/K._A._Applegate"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/61xtxjrseml-sx345-bo1204203200.jpg?itok=VYLYa0OA"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Turning Pages: My Life Story","datePublished":"2018-09-04","description":"Sonia Sotomayor has done a supreme job crafting her autobiography for kids, writing in a friendly, accessible style, and threading her life story with concrete examples of how books buoyed her.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/turning-pages-my-life-story","reviewBody":"Sonia Sotomayor has done a supreme job crafting her autobiography for kids, writing in a friendly, accessible style, and threading her life story with concrete examples of how books buoyed her. &quot;Turning Pages: My Life Story&quot; uses books as an organizing principle, spotlighting books at each stage.

Teens especially will relate to Flora and Evelyn as they navigate all kinds of transitions, both physical and spiritual, from child to adult, from naivete to knowing, from innocent to guilty, from girl to man.\nThe intriguing, well-paced story keeps the pages turning. So does the colorful cast of characters, both good and bad, as they navigate a rich, vast, and vividly imagined world. Violence and adult themes make it best for high schoolers and up.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Andrea Beach","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/andrea-beach"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Mermaid, the Witch, and the Sea","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/51710973-the-mermaid-the-witch-and-the-sea?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=miRLDNdbWO&rank=1","isbn":"978-1536204315","datePublished":"2020-05-05","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Maggie Tokuda-Hall","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/14160508.Maggie_Tokuda_Hall"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/thermermaidthewitchandthesea-book-product-image.jpg?itok=MKIe-D0B"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Thunderhead: Arc of a Scythe, Book 2","datePublished":"2018-02-03","description":"Second volumes of a thriller series often have a hard time maintaining momentum, but this sci-fi chiller delivers a finale that gleefully upends every expectation.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/thunderhead-arc-of-a-scythe-book-2","reviewBody":"Second volumes of a thriller series often have a hard time maintaining momentum, but this sci-fi chiller delivers a finale that gleefully upends every expectation. There is plenty to like about Thunderhead from its opening chapters, as Citra plays deadly political games and Rowan gets his hands dirty by gleaning the most corrupt scythes. Author Neal Shusterman poses tantalizing questions about free will and determinism but also keeps the novel's pacing taut and the action revved high. Rowan and Citra continue to be highly appealing characters, and even the villains possess interesting quirks. The climax of this volume is splendidly crazy, full of reversals and twists that no one will see coming. Readers will be left perfectly set up for the third volume, which may take the saga into space.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Berry","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/michael-berry"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Thunderhead: Arc of a Scythe, Book 2","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/33555224-thunderhead","isbn":"9781442472464","datePublished":"2018-01-09","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Neal Shusterman","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Neal_Shusterman"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/thunderhead-9781442472457-hr.jpg?itok=IkERBOh1"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Nevermoor: The Trials of Morrigan Crow","datePublished":"2017-11-01","description":"Kids will hide under the covers with a flashlight long after bedtime -- one more page!  -- to read this highly satisfying and engrossing new fantasy.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/nevermoor-the-trials-of-morrigan-crow","reviewBody":"Kids will hide under the covers with a flashlight long after bedtime -- one more page! -- to read this highly satisfying and engrossing new fantasy. With its page-turning plot, offbeat humor, quirkily colorful characters, and richly imagined fantasy world, &quot;Nevermoor: The Trials of Morrigan Crow&quot; has all the earmarks of a classic. The writing's stylish, with just enough Britishisms (\"brolly,\" \"chuffed\") to make readers feel they've been transported. Since Morrigan comes to Nevermoor without papers and risks deportation, author Jessica Townsend invites kids to think about issues related to immigration. And though Morrigan and her patron, Jupiter North, are white, other significant characters are people of color.\nThe messages embedded in the story are delivered meaningfully, in ways that feel psychologically smart. While Morrigan continues to feel the rejection from her family, Jupiter is the supportive parent figure every kid would want, and his own magical gift enables him to truly see her. In one exquisitely touching scene, he takes her face in his hands and does not break gaze as he staunchly reassures her. With fast-paced action and heart, Townsend's fantastical world feels truly \"Wundrous.\"","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jan Carr","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/jan-carr"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Nevermoor: The Trials of Morrigan Crow","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?isbn=0316508861","isbn":"978-0316508896","datePublished":"2017-10-31","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jessica Townsend","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/16727429.Jessica_Townsend?from_search=true"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/61vtu0oo-l-sx340-bo1204203200.jpg?itok=8QHZo96R"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Cardboard Kingdom","datePublished":"2018-07-30","description":"This kindhearted, warm, and funny graphic novel captures the many delights of imaginative play among old friends and newcomers to the neighborhood.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-cardboard-kingdom","reviewBody":"This kindhearted, warm, and funny graphic novel captures the many delights of imaginative play among old friends and newcomers to the neighborhood.

Readers are given a cliffhanger to start when one of the teens, Anaya, swoops over a remote island on a helicopter to find her dad, a botanist studying strange plants. It's clear the plants have taken over and everyone is in danger before the story pushes back just two weeks. A lot happens in those two weeks. The plants go from a simple nuisance to human-eating\/strangling\/burning\/gassing. And Anaya and two friends, Petra and Seth, go from teens with strange ailments to the only ones strangely immune to the plants.\nIt's a relief to leave town with the teens for medical testing. Bloom touches on the confusion of the plant takeover, the masks people wear for severe allergies, and the people who are no longer safe in their homes from the plants, but doesn't linger on these aspects. Readers follow the teens through their testing and their shock at what they find out (no spoilers here). It all sets up a nail-biter of a finale back on that helicopter trip and the next exciting chapter of the trilogy.  ","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

Sure she worries about school, issues with friends, and her secret boyfriend, but she's also the sole witness to the fatal shooting of her best friend by a police officer. In &quot;The Hate U Give&quot;, author Angie Thomas manages to bring humanity -- deep, emotionally binding, full-bodied humanity -- to the victims of police brutality and the families and friends they leave behind. The scenarios that revolve around the shooting are achingly routine -- unarmed African American, the media's push to blame the victim, a lax investigation, and a lack of charges or convictions. However, set against the backdrop of typical teen life, of community and family life, the consequences of the officer's actions and the actions others take after the tragedy take on a life and power beyond what any think piece or talking points on the subject could achieve. \nThe characters in the book are rich, complex, and fully developed. They feel like family, friends, and neighbors, and they give those unfamiliar with life in urban centers an understanding that the setting may be specific but the human condition is the universal. The tragedy and triumph of Thomas' stellar work is that it's very real and heartbreakingly familiar. Teens will enjoy the book for its unfiltered look at life, death, grief, and social and political commentary, while parents and teachers will enjoy the book's well-written and thorough approach to a complex social issue.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terreece Clarke","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/terreece-clarke"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Hate U Give","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/32075671-the-hate-u-give","isbn":"9780062871350","datePublished":"2017-02-28","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Angie Thomas","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/15049422.Angie_Thomas"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/the-hate-u-give.jpg?itok=1upfgbei"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Artemis Fowl, Book 1","datePublished":"2014-07-31","description":"This witty, exciting series start boasts an irresistible 12-year-old antihero and a host of fantastic characters.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/artemis-fowl-book-1","reviewBody":"This witty, exciting series start boasts an irresistible 12-year-old antihero and a host of fantastic characters.

At the same time, &quot;19 Love Songs&quot; is more generally like Levithan's valentine to the language of love. Through every plot twist and every nuance of feeling, the author shares his appreciation for all the tenderness between people, and the ways we use language to connect. Just one example of this is \"Track Fourteen: The Vulnerable Hours,\" in which Levithan imagines a magical time when every time one person asked another, \"What's up?\" Instead of saying \"Not much,\" person B would answer truthfully about important events and feelings in his or her life. In so many sweet ways, Levithan invites his readers to imagine what life would be like if people expressed their emotions, if we could be more real with those we love. These are ideas worth exploring, and in Levithan's world, all are welcome to do so.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Barbara Schultz","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/barbara-schultz"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"19 Love Songs","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.google.com\/books\/edition\/19_Love_Songs\/9FjDDwAAQBAJ?hl=en","isbn":"978-1984848635","datePublished":"2020-01-10","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"David Levithan","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David_Levithan"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/19lovesongs_0.jpg?itok=2l1kMO4g"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Dragons and Marshmallows: Zoey and Sassafras, Book 1","datePublished":"2020-06-10","description":"Filled with heart and brains, this start to the Zoey and Sassafrass series is a fun read with just the right mix of science and fantasy.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/dragons-and-marshmallows-zoey-and-sassafras-book-1","reviewBody":"Filled with heart and brains, this start to the Zoey and Sassafrass series is a fun read with just the right mix of science and fantasy.

The text in &quot;Blue Sky White Stars&quot; is more expressive than informational, with author Sarvinder Naberhaus repeating short phrases such as \"&quot;Blue Sky White Stars&quot;,\" \"Old Glory,\" and \"Woven together.\" She also includes phrases that sound alike but have different meanings -- for instance, \"Sew together\/Won nation\" (Betsy Ross sewing flag) and \"So together\/One nation\" (faces of various races). The spare text makes the book perfect for young kids, but older kids will enjoy thinking about the plays on words.\nThere could be no better illustrator for this project than Kadir Nelson, who pictures an inclusive, multiracial America and whose paintings of American faces, symbols, and landscapes are breathtaking and arresting. His choice of subject is always thought-provoking. In one spread, \"All American,\" he presents an image of a brightly lit baseball stadium next to an image of an older African American man listening to the game on the radio with his grandson.

For today's children, it  can be a challenge -- it definitely works best as a read-aloud, even for older kids -- but one well worth undertaking.\nIt's best in the original language, since the watered-down retellings don't do it justice. Readers will miss the complexity and darkness, as essential as the joy and adventure, captured in Barrie's exquisite prose as Peter watches through the window when the children are reunited with their parents: \"He had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must forever be barred.\" But be aware that it's rife with racist stereotypes of Native Americans and sexist stereotypes of girls and women.

And the ending does satisfy, though The Winterhouse Mysteries tries to tie up every loose end a little too neatly. It's hard not to be jealous of Elizabeth for getting to live at a hotel in her own room, with a massive library down the hall, a candy factory downstairs, and unique entertainment in the dining hall every night. Kids will want to look up Tuvan throat singing and what a lithophone sounds like. They will also enjoy solving more word puzzles with Elizabeth and her friend, Freddy.\nThe mystery builds well, thanks to a big cast of quirky characters who could all be involved in trying to help the resident vengeful ghost. Lots of little things add up: a missing book, rumblings in the dining room, and a parrot who knows just when to shout the ghost's name to give you the willies. And why on earth did Elizabeth steal that puzzle piece? All is revealed in the end. It's hard to say good-bye to Winterhouse and its mysteries, but it was a magical vacation while it lasted.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

Charles Dickens is universally regarded as one of the greatest novelists who ever wrote in the English language, if not any language, and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is considered, along with Bleak House, to be his best. Many of the characters are typical Dickens: quick sketches with colorfully descriptive names, representing a particular position and\/or attitude. The adult characters include Magwitch, the terrifying escaped criminal who sets Pip's adventures in motion, the insane Miss Havisham, the greedy Pumblechook, and the complex and contradictory Wemmick -- in other words, a credible cross-section of adult personalities.\nNineteenth-century literature, with its demanding vocabulary and old-fashioned assumptions and manners, is not everyone's cup of tea, and this includes young readers. But it continues, over a century later, to win new fans who fall in love with the book at a young age.

Part of Harry's appeal is that he could be any ordinary 11-year-old boy, an underdog readers will root for: small and skinny, with unruly hair, plus glasses held together with Scotch tape. But he also is bright and competent, and he discovers he has an aptitude for magic -- and Quidditch. Author J.K. Rowling also has taken everyday situations such as going to school, playing sports, and doing homework and convincingly combined them with fantasy to create a world more accessible to tweens than J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. From the school-supply lists (\"students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad\") to Quidditch (\"like soccer in the muggle world ... played up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls\"), the book is packed with entertaining details and creative riffs on modern life.\nThe gorgeous 2015 edition, featuring a new cover and showcasing more than 100 lovingly detailed illustrations by Jim Kay, will appeal to reluctant readers intimidated by the hefty text-only book. The illustrations decorate nearly every ink-stained page, and the play of perspective and light in each make them a wonderfully atmospheric addition to Rowling's story.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tara L.

Instead of an Introduction or Author's Note before the first chapter, CHARLOTTE DOYLE begins with An Important Warning. See From the Book below for that warning. From that promising beginning, the author sweeps us into a breathtaking and suspenseful adventure at sea.\n\tThe story is satisfying for several reasons. As an action-packed, edge-of-the-seat adventure, it should be appealing even to reluctant readers. It combines an exciting story with thought-provoking consideration of issues, such as bigotry, honor, justice, and the necessity of letting beliefs dictate actions. The characters, major and minor, are complex and unpredictable. And, of all of the genre-bending plot elements here, perhaps none is as enthralling as seeing a young teen girl take on a traditionally male role in the gender-divided 19th century, not by hiding who she is and pretending to be a boy, but by becoming her true self out of conviction and determination.\n\tFrom the Book:\n\tAn Important Warning\n\tNot every thirteen-year-old girl is accused of murder, brought to trial, and found guilty. But I was just such a girl, and my story is worth relating even if it did happen years ago. . .If strong ideas and action offend you, read no more. Find another companion to share your idle hours.

In &quot;The Poet X&quot;, author Elizabeth Acevedo takes readers through Xiomara's life as she finds herself being punished for simply existing and having the audacity to want to exist outside of the narrow boxes where society, religion, and her mother have decided she belongs. Readers can feel the shame, fear, and confusion Xiomara grapples with so much that they may have to resist the temptation to withdraw into themselves like Xiomara.\nAcevedo perfectly captures what it's like to have a changing body that suddenly becomes an indictment against who you are, even though you have no control over how it has blossomed into womanhood. The sexualization and policing of girls' bodies, and the silencing of their voices by those who install themselves as their protectors, is particularly striking in this moment of the #MeToo movement and the nationwide battles over school dress codes that unfairly target girls and women. The book is timely, sensitive, powerful, and hopeful. Families of both boys and girls can have great discussions about puberty, gender politics, religion, and finding your voice.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terreece Clarke","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/terreece-clarke"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Poet X","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/33294200-the-poet-x","isbn":"9781538500231","datePublished":"2018-03-06","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Elizabeth Acevedo","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/15253645.Elizabeth_Acevedo"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/poet-x.jpg?itok=B5jdQ_pZ"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Sex Is a Funny Word: A Book About Bodies, Feelings, and YOU","datePublished":"2020-07-18","description":"Not your typical book about sex for kids, this fun, honest volume covers the topic in new and exciting ways.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/sex-is-a-funny-word-a-book-about-bodies-feelings-and-you","reviewBody":"Not your typical book about sex for kids, this fun, honest volume covers the topic in new and exciting ways.

This book isn't actually about sex: It's about providing a foundation for kids to understand sex as a big, multifaceted life experience.\nAlso notable is the book's lack of jargon -- you won't find identity labels or advanced terms in the text (though there is a useful glossary) -- which means that all the different ways we talk about and define ourselves are available to use in the conversations this book will inspire. The interesting, diverse characters and inclusive language and art mean that every reader will be able to see themselves in this book.

Though some adult readers may at first find the avoidance of gender in &quot;What Makes a Baby&quot; odd (\"Some bodies have eggs, and some do not\"), the strength of this approach is that it allows parents to explain as much or as little about gender and bodies as they want. By dispensing with the standard mother-father model to describe how babies are made, this guide also affirms kids and families with single parents, same gender parents, grandparent caregivers, and so forth.

Stone moves beyond character archetypes into fully realized humans with a depth and fragility that's sometimes lost in current-events novels. From seeing the micro-aggressions and posttraumatic stress brought on by a frightening encounter with the police, to experiencing the everyday details of first relationships and parental expectations, readers slip easily into Justyce's mind and feelings, truly going on this journey with him.\n&quot;Dear Martin&quot; is told in an alternating mix of third-person narration, script-like dialogues, and letters to Martin Luther King Jr. It's well-written, honest, and a gut punch that leaves readers thinking about it for weeks after reading it.

Through other details, like the food at the lunch tables and the different kinds of families, the message that everyone is welcome and accepted as they are is warm and powerful here.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie Kingsley","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/carrie-kingsley"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"All Are Welcome","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/36959643-all-are-welcome?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=pvlPdMzP4Q&rank=2","isbn":"978-0525579649","datePublished":"2018-07-10","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Alexandra Penfold","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/6475425.Alexandra_Penfold"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/allarewelcome-book-image.jpg?itok=owOMUxjB"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Wait, What?: A Comic Book Guide to Relationships, Bodies, and Growing Up","datePublished":"2020-08-07","description":"Informative and funny, this slim book is a knock-out success when it comes to what tweens and teens need to know about puberty, gender, and sex.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/wait-what-a-comic-book-guide-to-relationships-bodies-and-growing-up","reviewBody":"Informative and funny, this slim book is a knock-out success when it comes to what tweens and teens need to know about puberty, gender, and sex. This is a great option for readers who find that puberty and sexuality guides often lack important information or use exclusionary language, &quot;Wait, What?: A Comic Book Guide to Relationships, Bodies, and Growing Up&quot; has a refreshing, positive stance towards sexuality: It's just another way to express yourself (by yourself and\/or with others, if\/when you're ready). The language affirms all genders (e.g. \"If you've got a vagina,\" \"people with a penis\") and sexualities (\"Gay? Straight? Both? Neither? Who even knows?\"). And it includes sexual assault in the discussion of consent. The nuance it brings to these topics shows a deep respect for tween and teen readers.\nOne surprising oversight is the lack of a discussion about body image. It's covered indirectly, but a more explicit approach would have affirmed the experiences of even more readers. There are no fat bodies in the illustrations either, which is out of step with this otherwise very inclusive guide. Still, the positives far outweigh this omission, and this guide is a great resource for tweens and teens.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mandie Caroll","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mandie-caroll"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Wait, What?: A Comic Book Guide to Relationships, Bodies, and Growing Up","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/en\/book\/show\/43822305-wait-what","isbn":"978-1620106594","datePublished":"2019-09-03","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Heather Corinna","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/84622.Heather_Corinna"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/wait-what-book-cover-image.jpg?itok=ELQweOco"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Juliet Takes a Breath","datePublished":"2020-07-25","description":"A funny, emotionally true book with an exceptionally compelling narrator.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/juliet-takes-a-breath","reviewBody":"A funny, emotionally true book with an exceptionally compelling narrator.

Tenderhearted &quot;David Copperfield&quot; was one of Charles Dickens' own favorite characters, and no wonder. He represents Dickens himself to some extent, and he's full of innocence and goodness -- qualities that make him lovable, and easy prey to some degree. This lengthy novel is full of wonderfully realized characters, from eccentric Betsey Trottwood and Mr. Dick to the steadfast Peggottys to the mean-spirited Murdstones and more. It has some surprisingly modern qualities, as well, despite its vintage (1850). Betsey Trottwood lives an unusual, independent life for a woman of her time. Dickens also reveals the failings of \"firmness\" in child rearing and education, and he emphasizes the joys of marriage when the couple are true partners in their life and work.

Gender-inclusive language and never-assumed heterosexuality gives a home to readers of any gender and sexual orientation. This book certainly has a progressive agenda: Respect young people's autonomy to make informed choices that are right for them, at a pace that feels safe, with the goal of developing a healthy sexuality. Adults will benefit from reading this guide before handing it off to teens, and they will probably even learn a thing or two. Many may think, \"I wish this existed when I was a teenager.\"\nOne quibble concerns advice (in the body image chapter) to talk with a doctor or nurse if you feel like you need to diet or feel bad about your body. Given the fact that anti-fat bias in healthcare has led some healthcare providers to prescribe unhealthy, non-evidence-based interventions to patients, this could be problematic advice. But since that's the only critique in nearly 500 pages, this guide still comes out on top as a must-have for the teen years and beyond. \n ","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mandie Caroll","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mandie-caroll"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"S.E.X.: The All-You-Need-To-Know Sexuality Guide to Get You Through Your Teens and Twenties","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/35432084-s-e-x-second-edition?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=xbSI00ocel&rank=1","isbn":"978-0738218847","datePublished":"2016-07-16","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Heather Corinna","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/84622.Heather_Corinna"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/sex-book-cover-image.jpg?itok=sYtYg-t5"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Space Case: Moon Base Alpha, Book 1","datePublished":"2014-10-06","description":"Stuart Gibbs' books often follow similar formulas, but they are exceptionally well-written, rewarding reads -- and SPACE CASE is no different.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/space-case-moon-base-alpha-book-1","reviewBody":"Stuart Gibbs' books often follow similar formulas, but they are exceptionally well-written, rewarding reads -- and SPACE CASE is no different.

The same fast pace, clever quips, and twists and turns are here, but Gibbs takes extra care to paint a picture of equally talented men and women, with girl hackers, racially diverse scientists, and kids often taken as seriously as adults, all done in a matter-of-fact way that feels natural.\nOverall, it's a fun read that manages to have it both ways. It praises smarts and education and still has a lot of action-packed, suspense-filled fun.

There are also some very sensitive and skillfully executed scenes of a boy and girl renegotiating their friendship as middle-school peer pressure begins to come between them.

Much like the Little House series, &quot;Prairie Lotus&quot; is a fascinating account the everyday life of people who lived in a time before electricity yet enjoyed education and commerce, and who forged new lives in a New World. Hanna knows her life depends on the kindness of others. As seen from a teen's point of view, her honor, duty and fate are tightly bound with her father's. When he says jump, she really jumps -- his survival instincts have him close to exploding. It's a far cry from the warmth and ease that Pa in the Little House books can afford to share with his children. \nKids will appreciate how strong Hanna is, and how she listens to her mother's wisdom, which lives inside of her, and which helps her navigate the spitefulness of her fellow human beings. Hanna loves to design dresses, which will appeal to fashionable middle graders. She learns to use her skill to woo people into accepting her, which middle graders will also understand. Hanna's life is an example of a story that was never told. In this book, her story helps open hearts and change minds.

A soothing gemstone-colored palette mirrors the way Eva and her mother calm themselves down after each setback. Their not-so-tidy apartment will be recognized (and appreciated) by hardworking parents who prioritize time with kids over a spotless house. Social class and the absence of a second parent for Eva are broached with a light hand that allows families to discuss these topics as deeply as they wish. The diversity is not superficial here. Black people of various skin colors are represented, and background characters of color are seen engaged in activities like yoga and painting.\nThe two-page spread of Eva comforting her mother is deeply moving, and the story ends on a creative and comforting high note. The vocabulary is mostly simple, and structures repeat in a rhythmic manner that underscores the importance of being able to self-soothe.

Logan County is a strange place, but in &quot;The Last Last-Day-of-Summer&quot;, author Lamar Giles makes it seem appealing, even when a giant platypus runs amok. Otto and Sheed are highly likable main characters: inquisitive, brave, and true to each other. Their antagonist is both annoying and dangerous, and the cousins' confrontations with various aspects of time are clever and sometimes even moving. Dapo Adeola's black-and-white spot illustrations lend a touch of reality to a story that includes robots, mirrors full of tentacles, and giant marsupials. Giles seems just to be getting started exploring Logan County, and middle-grade readers will welcome further adventures for Otto and Sheed -- boys especially.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Michael Berry","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/michael-berry"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Last Last-Day-of-Summer","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/39727174-the-last-last-day-of-summer","isbn":"9781432870423","datePublished":"2019-04-02","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lamar Giles","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/6571558.Lamar_Giles"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/lastdayofsummer.jpg?itok=N-e8feeI"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"With the Fire on High","datePublished":"2019-05-02","description":"Teens will love the diverse characters, heartwarming relationships, and deliciously rich descriptions of Emoni\u2019s dishes in Elizabeth Acevedo\u2019s inspiring coming-of-age tale.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/with-the-fire-on-high","reviewBody":"Teens will love the diverse characters, heartwarming relationships, and deliciously rich descriptions of Emoni\u2019s dishes in Elizabeth Acevedo\u2019s inspiring coming-of-age tale.

Every metaphor, theme, or lush image has a specific purpose in the story. Like Australian YA author Melina Marchetta, Stiefvater's stories are full of complex characters and multiple storylines that are all important to explore. The four titular Raven boys aren't your typical clique of best pals; they're a complicated bunch of friends. Each has enough psychological issues to deserve his own book (and with three more installments in the series, we'll obviously learn even more about each one).\nThe most interesting contrast is between the two obvious possibilities for Blue's love: Gansey, whom she sees in her vision and is the driving force behind the search for Glendower's ghost, and Adam, whom she was initially attracted to and who so desperately wants to use his intelligence to leave his trailer-trash background behind and join his best friends in their world of easy privilege. Blue is a fantastic guide into the world of the Anglionby boys. She's been surrounded by her mother and other clairvoyant women her whole life and wants to experience true friendship and adventure -- even if it means risking her heart and the life of her eventual true love. Beautifully written and compellingly paced, this is a unique series that both teens and adult readers will find riveting.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Raven Boys:The Raven Cycle, Book 1","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=2qLUMpq3bzIC","isbn":"9780545424936","datePublished":"2012-09-18","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Maggie Stiefvater","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maggie_Stiefvater"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/raven-boys.jpg?itok=bGLd-JMV"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"P.S.

There's something magical about Rowell's coming-of-age tales, so this expansion of Fangirl is brilliant. Featuring a diverse and compelling set of characters, Carry On works, because Rowell is such a natural, humorous storyteller who captures the feelings of first love and self-discovery. It may initially be hard not to think of Simon as Harry, Penelope as a combination of both Ron and Hermione (she's initially a redhead and comes from a huge middle-class family), and Watford as Hogwarts, but as the story continues, those similarities fall away, and Rowell takes Simon on his own original journey. And of course, since Rowell is an expert in the slow-burning romance, the love story here is far more central than all that blink-and-miss snogging at Hogwarts.\nThe strength of Carry On is that once again Rowell doesn't soft-peddle the confusion and frustration of being a teenager, something that's amplified tenfold for an orphaned wizard such as Simon Snow. Not only is Simon working through his uncontrollable magic that just \"goes off\" like a bomb, he's also pretty obviously captivated with Baz, who in turn has always been in love with Simon and used his snobbery and disdain to mask his attraction. In lesser hands, the whole magical-world-building, character development, and gay romance would've crumpled under the weight of too many story lines, but Rowell has imbued Carry On with so much depth and humor that readers will instantly want to reread it and once again cheer for Simon to earn a happily ever after.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Carry On: Simon Snow Series, Book 1","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/23734628-carry-on","isbn":"9781250135025","datePublished":"2015-10-22","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rainbow Rowell","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rainbow_Rowell"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/enhanced-19465-1429806575-15.jpg?itok=eARgQo85"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Fangirl","datePublished":"2013-09-09","description":"&quot;Fangirl&quot; isn't just a charming love story about people, it's also a love story about fiction and the power of books and fandoms.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/fangirl","reviewBody":"&quot;Fangirl&quot; isn't just a charming love story about people, it's also a love story about fiction and the power of books and fandoms. Rowell, whose first book Attachments was a \"chick lit\" romantic comedy, burst onto the YA scene early in 2013 with the critically acclaimed misfit romance Eleanor &amp; Park. She's apparently cranking out the quality realistic fiction with her follow-up out a scant eight months later. &quot;Fangirl&quot; shares a few similarities with E&amp;P: the Nebraska setting, an intelligent, introverted girl who doesn't say much, and a guy who's almost too good to be true.\nEvery chapter begins with excerpts from not only Cath's fanfiction but also the \"canon\" of the Potter-like Simon Snow books. If you pay even cursory attention to the book-within-a-book, it's obvious that Simon, Baz, and Gemma T. Leslie are stand-ins for Harry, Draco, and author J.K. Rowling. Through her writing, Cath can express things she can't in real life, where she's extremely reclusive and socially inept. The only person besides Cath's party-girl sister, Wren, who can see the real her is Levi -- the kind of swoon-worthy guy that's sure to become any reader's literary crush. Cath and Levi have a host of issues, but their romance, slow and steady and startlingly real, will make anyone a believer in how books and love go hand in hand.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Fangirl","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=BfseA9a8xVMC","isbn":"9786071134653","datePublished":"2013-09-10","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rainbow Rowell","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rainbow_Rowell"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/16068905.jpg?itok=FPcp0foW"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Darius the Great Is Not Okay","datePublished":"2019-02-20","description":"This gentle, heartwarming cross-cultural coming-of-age story delivers a profound message of hope for any teen who's struggled with depression or felt they'd never fit in.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/darius-the-great-is-not-okay","reviewBody":"This gentle, heartwarming cross-cultural coming-of-age story delivers a profound message of hope for any teen who's struggled with depression or felt they'd never fit in.

Once again Perkins uses the setting -- in this case, San Francisco -- as a central character in the book. And unlike Anna, whose story was set in a boarding school, Lola has a fantastic homelife with two doting dads and a feisty dog cleverly named \"Heavens to Betsy.\" Lola is self-possessed and quirky -- a Lady Gaga-lite who creates fabulous costumes as an extension of her personality. She's beautiful, funny, and comfortable in her skin, so it's hard to resist Lola's charms as a protagonist.\nBut despite Lola's love of presentation, she's nakedly vulnerable when it comes to Cricket. His re-emergence in her life makes her rethink whether her relationship with Max, the 22-year-old punk star, is the Real Thing or a first love that can't go the distance. As Cricket and Lola reconnect -- adorably via their facing second-story windows -- readers will undeniably root for the impossibly tall inventor to win Lola's heart. As an added bonus, Lola works at a movie theater with Anna and the ever-present St. Clair, making it clear that their intercontinental love story is of the forever variety. With its vivid descriptions of how friendship blooms into love, this is a winning romance with sparkly language and a lot of heart.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Lola and the Boy Next Door","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=5JwPgVVk4lUC","isbn":"978-0142422014","datePublished":"2011-09-29","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Stephanie Perkins","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stephanie_Perkins"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/lola-boy-next-door.jpg?itok=5tPB-r6y"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Night Circus","datePublished":"2011-10-04","description":"&quot;The Night Circus&quot; is a rich, dreamy tale of theatrical enchantment and thwarted love.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-night-circus","reviewBody":"&quot;The Night Circus&quot; is a rich, dreamy tale of theatrical enchantment and thwarted love.

And the very idea of each of us showing different selves to different people is something almost any teen reader can identify with.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Barbara Schultz","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/barbara-schultz"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Every You, Every Me","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/9972838-every-you-every-me","isbn":"978-0375854514","datePublished":"2011-09-13","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"David Levithan","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David_Levithan"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/every-cover-3.jpg?itok=FPcKW8S0"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Playground","datePublished":"2011-10-28","description":"The author, rapper 50 Cent, made the right choice when deciding to tell the story from Butterball's perspective.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/playground","reviewBody":"The author, rapper 50 Cent, made the right choice when deciding to tell the story from Butterball's perspective.

We can both empathize with Butterball's plight and be infuriated by his naivete and foolishness.\nThe story gives a pretty even-handed account of how bullies like Butterball are often created -- through poor treatment by other bullies and, in his case, poor examples set by authority figures.

Edwardson's strengths lie in her poetic imagery and complex characterizations that let you understand each person's motives and emotions. However, though the situations of each character are varied and the family history of each is interesting, the voices themselves are not always distinct.

Conrad's classic novella maintains an impressive sense of dread while at the same time offering a searing critique of imperialism at a time when the expansion of the British Empire and the exploitation of Africa by European powers was glorified as bringing \"light\" to uncivilized populations. Kurtz's greedy pursuit of ivory, which consumes him and overrides and extinguishes any conscience or morality he once had, is a metaphor for the foreign policy of Conrad's day and remains relevant today.\nOften required reading in high school, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is a powerful work of early modern fiction, full of psychological reflection and interior monologues by Marlow, who is trying to make sense of what he is seeing. (Conrad himself made a life-changing trip to the Congo with a Belgian company in 1890, serving as captain of a Congo River steamer, an experience that informs this novella.) Students may be pleased that it is only about 90 pages long, but it is not an easy read. Readers will find they must take it slow to grasp the nuances of Conrad's commentary and understand the historical context of imperial conquest, where racist domination of indigenous people was officially sanctioned by conquering countries.

It has Handler's trademark cleverness with quick dialogue and references throughout to outrageous, invented classic films, but it convincingly captures what it feels like to really, truly fall for someone -- and obsess until nothing else in your life matters -- and also what it feels like to lose that person.\nMin isn't always the most likable person, and the box of treasures she is building to return to Ed seems a bit juvenile and overdramatic -- but it's authentic. She is, after all, a dramatic girl -- and she's aware she has her share of faults (\"I sweat everywhere, my arms, the way I clumsy around dropping things, my average grades and stupid interests, bad breath, pants tight in back, my neck too long or something,\" she writes as part of a really long list of things she loathes about herself). And readers will appreciate that Handler makes them understand why she and Ed -- who are so obviously different from each other -- would work so hard to be together, even while readers know their romance is doomed. In the end, this is a good choice for Snicket fans now grown up, as well as other romantic readers who like a good cry. And Maira Kalman's clever illustrations add to the inventive storytelling.

Big secrets come to light about the twins, their parents, and the orchestrations of Abraham the Mage. The only thing that stands out as strange: The twins' story doesn't dominate, as you might expect in a young-adult series. Every one of Scott's key fascinating characters plays a part here and gets a truly grand send-off.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Carrie R.

This kickoff to a trilogy will certainly give teens plenty to think about, from the pros and cons of technology's growing role in our lives (and our bodies) -- to how much power corporations should have over global politics. Of course, there's plenty of fun stuff, too: Sci-fi fans will enjoy engaging virtual gaming sequences as Tom trains with his unit to learn tactics and teamwork -- sometimes appearing as wolves or characters from Camelot. Also, a programming assignment has the teens infecting one another with viruses that make them do silly things, such as bleat like sheep. \nReaders who stick with Tom's story will understand his ego-driven decision to become a trainee and appreciate his growing sense of community with the other misfits in his class as he rises in rank. Even so, they'll suspect that future volumes of this fun, thrilling series will see him dismantle the same military that has turned him into a powerful weapon.

Her books, while completely different from one another, each feature her gift for details that are obviously the result of painstaking research. She also has a penchant for creating protagonists, in this case Evie, who are far from the cookie-cutter stereotype of teen girls looking for love or a misfit wallflower with no voice. Evie is loud and chatty, and what she wants, far more than romance (which she's not even bothered with), is adventure, glamour, and kinship.\nThis is not a book for the faint of heart or for those seeking the easy girl-meets-boy romance. Bray is a sophisticated writer, and her writing demands the reader to pay attention and sometimes cower in fear along with her characters (the multiple points of view include those of the serial killer's victims). There's a ton of slang (\"swell\" and \"say\" and \"pal-ski,\" to name just a few) and decade-specific references that may go over many teens' heads, but that's part of the joy of the story. It dares teens to find out if there was such a thing as the Pillar of Fire church commune, the Cotton Club, and Ziegfeld girls (yes, yes, and yes). With a varied and well-drawn cast of characters that range from a Pennsylvania Dutch intellectual to a rakish Russian pickpocket to a handsome Harlem healer, this is a book that requires time to finish (it's more than 600 pages), but it's such a satisfying stand-alone read.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"The Diviners, Book 1","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=pyvAm40gAlsC","isbn":"978-0316126113","datePublished":"2012-09-18","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Libba Bray","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Libba_Bray"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/the-diviners-us.jpg?itok=xXPr1BQ2"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Survivors: The Empty City","datePublished":"2012-09-18","description":"Erin Hunter's previous animal series have a large, devoted following, and this one is off to a promising start.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/survivors-the-empty-city","reviewBody":"Erin Hunter's previous animal series have a large, devoted following, and this one is off to a promising start.

Liza isn't fearless, but she's purposeful; she knows that if she doesn't get to Patrick, he will be lost to her -- and her parents -- forever. It's hard not to root for a sister who's so dedicated to her pesky little brother.\nThe underworld that Oliver has created is inventive, if occasionally derivative (the moribats sure seem like the Wicked Witch's flying monkeys). The idea of every person having their own dream-bringer -- the nocturni -- is particularly compelling, as are some of the riddles and tests that Liza must master to find Patrick.

Although she could easily save herself from the perpetual grief and humiliation of being branded the small military town's biggest slut, Quinn convincingly reveals why telling the truth would be such an unthinkable betrayal of Carey, whom she loves unconditionally. The fact that his best friend Blake was the (unrecognizable) guy in the photo makes things ever more complicated. He, too, could step forward and defend Quinn, but doing so would devastate Carey's parents even more.\nQuinn's ordeal -- everyone at her school seems to hate her, even the girls who used to be her best friends -- is tempered by the one relationship in her life that is uncomplicated and sweet. As a volunteer at the VA hospital, Quinn strikes up a close friendship with George, and elderly vet who encourages and supports Quinn when no one else will. Their conversations are the only moments in &quot;If I Lie&quot; that aren't tainted by her reputation. There's also a forbidden romance between Quinn and Blake (he doesn't know the truth about Carey) that simmers until it boils over into a declaration of love. But &quot;If I Lie&quot; is not a romance; this is a story about sacrifice, loyalty, and acceptance. With her compelling, complicated protagonist, Jackson will make readers think hard about truth, love, and duty.\n ","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"If I Lie","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/10564983-if-i-lie","isbn":"978-1442454132","datePublished":"2012-08-28","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Corrine Jackson","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/4668167.Corrine_Jackson"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/978-1-4424-5413-2.jpg?itok=dI9m6fvr"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Pete the Cat Saves Christmas","datePublished":"2012-11-05","description":"&quot;Pete the Cat Saves Christmas&quot; has more story than other Pete the Cat books, and Pete seems less dazed and more than just deadpan.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/pete-the-cat-saves-christmas","reviewBody":"&quot;Pete the Cat Saves Christmas&quot; has more story than other Pete the Cat books, and Pete seems less dazed and more than just deadpan.

It's hard to watch her repeatedly run away, sputter, and try to tune out when things hurt too much. But by the same token, the book deals with extremely disturbing events, and Claire's reaction -- her suffering, her guilt -- seems quite realistic.

The mystery element of the novel is brief and quickly resolved, but what's there is suspenseful and engaging. This is a meaningful book for teens who can handle serious emotional content.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Barbara Schultz","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/barbara-schultz"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Emily's Dress and Other Missing Things","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/13411468-emily-s-dress-and-other-missing-things","isbn":"978-1596437364","datePublished":"2012-10-02","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kathryn Burak","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/837300.Kathryn_Burak"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/emilydress.jpg?itok=Y7TqpL8t"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel","datePublished":"2012-11-20","description":"Jeff Kinney's capacity to embarrass his character, Greg Heffley, and amuse his readers seems to know no bounds.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-the-third-wheel","reviewBody":"Jeff Kinney's capacity to embarrass his character, Greg Heffley, and amuse his readers seems to know no bounds.

There's a lot of interest from the convoluted family dynamics, including Jules' father sinking into depression and hints of something having gone very wrong in the past. With much of the action necessarily happening in Jules' head, as it centers on something only she can see, the story bogs down and becomes repetitive in midstream as she revisits what she's seeing and tries to decide what to do about it.

That said, Mead's focus on the star-crossed lovers comes at the expense of secondary characters Jill, Angeline, Eddie, and Trey; there's considerably less about them here than in the first two novels, but it's clear they will feature more prominently in upcoming stories.\nAlthough there's action and intrigue -- particularly about the former Alchemists who want to \"break\" the ceremonial tattoo that bonds them to the order -- this book is mostly about Sydney's character development. An Alchemist trained to regard vampires with a healthy dose of revulsion, Sydney knows that her blossoming and at times overwhelming feelings for Adrian go against everything she's been taught -- as does her newfound proficiency with magic.

Ruta Sepetys -- whose excellent debut novel, Between Shades of Gray, was also set against a brutal backdrop -- again delivers a richly rewarding story. Her heroine is feisty and frustrated, struggling to keep her estranged, malevolent mother from sinking her.\nThe plot occasionally veers toward melodrama, but Sepetys' strong, fresh writing keeps it anchored. A fairly large chunk of the story, set in the 1950s, takes place among the women in the brothel. Sepetys presents them with compassion -- there's no discussion of how or why women become prostitutes, and the only moral judgment is Josie's disdain for the johns and the work the women do, despite her fondness for Willie and many of her \"nieces.\" The book's website includes a discussion guide.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Darienne Stewart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/darienne-stewart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Out of the Easy","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=dZG5sUY2tZMC","isbn":"978-0399256929","datePublished":"2013-02-12","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ruta Sepetys","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ruta_Sepetys"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/outoftheeasy-book-cover.jpg?itok=4b5LoUoT"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Hattie Ever After","datePublished":"2013-02-13","description":"Fans of Larson's Hattie Big Sky will be delighted to find much the same narrator here: Hattie is strong, good-hearted and brave about sharing her mistakes as she tries to become a reporter.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/hattie-ever-after","reviewBody":"Fans of Larson's Hattie Big Sky will be delighted to find much the same narrator here: Hattie is strong, good-hearted and brave about sharing her mistakes as she tries to become a reporter. &quot;Hattie Ever After&quot; is well researched, and readers will get a good sense of city life just before the 1920s, from the era's fashion and politics to what it was like for women to fight their way into the workforce.

As teens, both Pressia Belze and Partridge Willux are questioning their identities and developing their values. Driven by their internal sense of right and wrong, they fight to both uncover their personal secrets and find some justice in the midst of an unfair division between the \"&quot;Pure&quot;s\" and the \"wretches,\" or those who were protected from the devastating Detonations, and those who were not.\nBaggott's writing is particularly lovely, evoking tender feelings, heightened emotions, and the brutal landscape of her imagination. Teen and adult readers will be spooked by the gruesome imagery, but fascinated, too. Readers can draw connections between the items fused to each character (such a as a doll head fused to a hand) and that individual's personality, as well as connections between the moral issues related to power and corruption and real-life politics and culture.

The three girls feel like kids you would find in any neighborhood in America. \nThis is also a wonderful book to help bring to life what it was like to grow up in a time with so much societal change. While the issues at hand may be different -- different wars, different societal constraints being challenged, etc. -- &quot;P.S. Be Eleven&quot; offers many parallels with what's happening in today's society. Minority groups still struggle to have their voices heard, middle school is still a hotbed of akwardness and rivalry, war still sends home wounded soldiers who struggle long after the bandages come off, and parents still strive to connect with their kids. Readers easily identify with the characters and their daily struggles and triumphs, making this a classic for the home library.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Terreece Clarke","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/terreece-clarke"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"P.S.

The pain of having an endless to-do list for school, of trying to keep one step ahead on the good-grades, good-college, good-job track, of trying to please parents who mean well but also keep a sharp eye on their bright child's \"amazing journey\" -- this is the pain that &quot;It's Kind of a Funny Story&quot; compellingly describes, and that many kids can relate to.  \nCraig describes the accessory-heavy style of his dreamgirl classmate this way: \"I think her accessories were a courtesy meant to distract from her small, lucrative body and baby-doll face.\" A parent-free teen party in a Manhattan apartment is rendered in wild, sensational detail, and so is a poker game played by a cast of mentally stricken patients. If your teen is ready for the graphic (but not lewd) descriptions of petting and the pervasive use of drugs, this will be a dazzling read.

Hopefully, it also will help them forgive themselves, and each other, when they do make errors in judgment.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kate Pavao","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/kate-pavao"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Thousand Words","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=eDsucDr6XQsC","isbn":"978-0316209724","datePublished":"2013-05-21","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jennifer Brown","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/432859.Jennifer_Brown"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/thousand-words.jpg?itok=1wLVDpbk"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Moon and More","datePublished":"2013-06-04","description":"Sarah Dessen succeeds again in &quot;The Moon and More&quot; with authentic teen characters finding their way through messy circumstances.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-moon-and-more","reviewBody":"Sarah Dessen succeeds again in &quot;The Moon and More&quot; with authentic teen characters finding their way through messy circumstances.

Author Meg Medina, who specializes in Latino protagonists, delves into the unique relationship between an only child and a single mother, the expectations and rules and supervision that make it difficult for Piddy to tell her Mami the truth.\nMost of the time, bullying is discussed in terms of social media and cyberstalking, but old-fashioned face-to-face bullying happens as well (although the mean girls also take a phone snapshot of a bruised and half-naked Piddy), and Medina captures the fear and pain of facing your attacker day in and day out -- without any hope of reprieve. &quot;Yaqui Delgado Wants to Kick Your Ass&quot; should be taught in schools, read by counselors and parents, and used as a tool to discuss the importance of finding your voice, telling the truth and asking for help.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Yaqui Delgado Wants to Kick Your Ass","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=1DMS_CTfmwkC","isbn":"978-0763658595","datePublished":"2013-03-26","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Meg Medina","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/1373005.Meg_Medina"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/yaquidelgado.jpeg?itok=v_49V0_5"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"Foundation","datePublished":"2012-06-27","description":"","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/foundation","reviewBody":"While there's enough interesting conversation to evoke a spacefaring My Dinner with Andre, many young readers may find &quot;Foundation&quot; long on talk, but short on action and intriguing characters.\nScience fiction is the turf of big ideas; Asimov, with a genius IQ and a broad range of interests, had more big ideas than most, many of them on display here: Is it possible to predict and\/or manipulate the future? What about free will? What's the relationship of science, religion, politics, and money? Who's really in control here? Who should be? The downside is that characters, many of whom appear only briefly, are almost exclusively defined by their wise sayings and long speeches, and don't so much develop as tenaciously hold their positions as events unfold. \nHugely influential, the &quot;Foundation&quot; Trilogy (&quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot; and Empire, and Second &quot;Foundation&quot;) received science fiction's Hugo Award for Best All-Time Series in 1966, the only year the award's ever been presented.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Mary Eisenhart","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/mary-eisenhart"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"Foundation","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/29579.Foundation","isbn":"978-0553382570","datePublished":"2008-04-29","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Isaac Asimov","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/16667.Isaac_Asimov"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/foundation.jpg?itok=_qprFXOX"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Year of the Baby: Anna Wang, Book 2","datePublished":"2013-06-26","description":"Like The Year of the Book, The Year of the Baby is a sweet and honest look at a young girl's everyday worries about family, friends, and school.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-year-of-the-baby-anna-wang-book-2","reviewBody":"Like The Year of the Book, The Year of the Baby is a sweet and honest look at a young girl's everyday worries about family, friends, and school.

Using the device of a documentary series (like the famous British 7 Up) to highlight how a group of kids have interacted since kindergarten, Castle is able to explore the dynamics of friendship and school life at ages 6, 11, and 16. Although the action takes place when the five documentary subjects are 16, there are plenty of flashbacks to the other two ages that shed light on why the kids are perceived a particular way. Felix, for example, the only full minority (he's Dominican), feels marginalized and ready for what he believes is his well-earned close-up in the newest documentary. While Nate, the son of the town's leading farming family, has completely changed his reputation from round-face bunny-loving bully victim to gorgeous swim star.\nThe three girls also have fascinating transformations and backstories. The novel's protagonist, Justine, had the most screen time in the second film, Five at 11, but she no longer feels she has much to contribute. She's worried about interacting with Rory, her former best friend, whom she dropped soon after his autism diagnosis, and she's suspicious of the relationship between Nate (whom she can't help but find attractive) and the beautiful Keira, whose mother abandoned her during the shoot five years earlier. In an age where so many teens engage in reality television and social media, &quot;You Look Different in Real Life&quot; captures the way leading a semi-public life (even just every five years) has deeply affected these teens who aren't always sure if they're acting for the cameras or being themselves. When everyone thinks they know you, how do you know yourself? In the end, each of the five kids has his or her moment in the spotlight (whether through tragedy, triumph, or both) and ends up the better for it.","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Sandie Angulo Chen","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/users\/sandie-angulo-chen"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Book","name":"You Look Different in Real Life","sameAs":"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=oYi4FXvVT9gC","isbn":"978-0061985812","datePublished":"2013-06-04","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jennifer Castle","sameAs":"http:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/397315.Jennifer_Castle"}},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Common Sense Media","sameAs":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"4"},"image":"https:\/\/d2e111jq13me73.cloudfront.net\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/product_image_aspect_switcher_170w\/public\/product-images\/csm-book\/16065592.jpg?itok=_bviwz9l"},{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Review","name":"The Strange Case of Origami Yoda: Origami Yoda, Book 1","datePublished":"2012-06-28","description":"Middle school's awkward moments are fodder for ORIGAMI YODA, a funny, charming little book about tween crushes and friendships.","url":"https:\/\/www.commonsensemedia.org\/book-reviews\/the-strange-case-of-origami-yoda-origami-yoda-book-1","reviewBody":"Middle school's awkward moments are fodder for ORIGAMI YODA, a funny, charming little book about tween crushes and friendships.
